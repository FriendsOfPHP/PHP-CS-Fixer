:-1: because we don't actually support them ourselves.

:+1:
since PSR 5 does not provide an alternative for something like `array<int, string>`

True. I'm :-1: only until I can actually get our fixers updated to support this stuff. Once the current phpdoc PRs have gone through, I can start working on it.

@GrahamCampbell , that's why I extracted this into separate request and write:

> We should start supporting generic types in docs.

treat this as feature request.

it's not ready to be merged.
it's usage examples, but we do not really support them by our phpdoc fixers :(

do these break the tags? I would do this on 2.x and ship it ;)

It may.
Before merging we should adjust docblock namespace to properly handle collection types (eg space inside type!) and then ensure all phpdoc fixers playing with type are still working properly
