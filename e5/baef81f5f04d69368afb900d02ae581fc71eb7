then we need a second fixer (risky one) that will fix all the rest...

I think this is a bug fix, so do not need such a fixer for BC reasons. Do you think someone really wants it?

I know at least one: me!

me too .actually most of community. the only thing is that it's risky.

we have exactly the same problem with trailing spaces. PSR requires to not have them in non-empty lines - even if it's part of string var. but then it modifies a content, so it's risky. but still, most of us wanna follow that.

It's bugfix but also shrinking functionality. Now one cannot fix linefeed inside var content. could you prepare the new fixer as well please? it's really important for us ! :)

alrighty, would a config flag work as well or you really want a diff. fixer?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was thinking about the config as well, but then you need to dynamically say if the fixer is risky or not depends on config.

I'm kind of happy with this PR as is, but if we need another fixer please provide names for both fixers and I'll update this PR :)

as discussed it could be an option. the only thing to keep in mind is risky vs not risky... depends on used options

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK, I treat it as bugfix after thinking about it. Missing functionality is raised here: #2224
