@kubawerlos , should we close #5566 with merge of this PR?

@keradus well, the simple answer is no, as this is only extending test to make it more explicit, so the other issue is already fixed or won't be fixed by this. Let me take a look at the other issue.

EDIT: I remember now, this one is to show that the issue reported there was actually solved, so I guess it makes sense if merging this will close #5566.
