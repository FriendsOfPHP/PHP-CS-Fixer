What is happening when disabling linter on php 7?
If I see it correctly the code is linted anyway, because of `TOKEN_PARSE`. But the exception for invalid files is not catched, because `TokenizerLinter` is not used.

Remember it's very early preview ;)
Indeed, on 7.x linter should be enforced.

I still think linting should be always enforeced and we should never fix invalid files (especially files from higher php versions).

The problem is that for PHP5 you are not always able to enforce linting, as you need to find PHP executable path

I often want to turn off linting so I can debug bad fixers.

one way or another for PHP7 linting would be always enabled thanks to Tokenizer change for semi-reserved keywords

What's the status here?

I would guess it needs some dev time to be finished

Also, updated initial PR comment

Perhapse a linter factory would be better than having a linter wrapper class?

It was my first implementation. Then I got sick of it to replace the usage everywhere so I decided to kept the original name as is and encapsulate decision which linter will be use for component, so one could treat Process/Tokenizer Linters only as private classes for Linter namespace (as if it would be possible in PHP, like in C#)
