I like the change to remove the `_toString()` method/call. The test is a good idea as well but as keradus pointed out we already do it :)

So maybe update the PR to only keep the `_toString()` deprecation?

@keradus @SpacePossum what about making the strict check mandatory?

(Travis will fail until [this](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/4098) is merged)

maybe we can add the `strict_types` to the standard PHP 7 job without all the other risky ones from the migration sets?
