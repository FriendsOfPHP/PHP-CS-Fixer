you should have created your branch from the upstream master branch, not from your previous feature branch, as your previous commits have been squashed together before merging the PR

you should rebase it on top of the master branch (using ``git rebase --onto upstream/master <ancestor>`` to avoid rebasing the commits which are parts of the previous PR (``<ancestor>`` being the last commit of the previous PR).
