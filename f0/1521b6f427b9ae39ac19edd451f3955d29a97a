It looks like this does not fix my case.

It works well without a default value, but that's the case before this fix too ðŸ¤”

Can you extend your test case like proposed in my comment?

@OskarStark added, since in https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/issues/5533 you haven't added a config I can only guess, let's go with this one and verify if you still have the issue.

Might be another bug lurking at us.
