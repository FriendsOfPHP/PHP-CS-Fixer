Nice :clap:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Move responsibility of resolving `config` into `ConfigurationResolver`, so we can add tests for it now ;)

Maybe this would be better targeted at 2.0?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-12-14T20:49:05Z

Is this breaks BC?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-12-14T21:17:06Z

It is an unexpected change in behaviour, and breaks things still marked as "api" in 1.x.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-12-14T21:30:27Z

ow, right, I have changed ConfigurationResolver public interface!
Thanks, marked as BC break !

Due to referred discussion - I have added a todo in first post:

Actually,moving that one into #873

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by dereuromark at 2014-12-18T21:20:43Z

I would remove the coverage reports. It is just unnecessary and useless noise.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-12-18T21:25:11Z

Refs: #848

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-12-18T21:50:04Z

implementation ready ;)
more tests needed...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-12-18T21:50:57Z

Awesome.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-12-20T19:33:54Z

ConfigurationResolver now resolves path, isDryRun and isStdIn

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-12-20T20:47:42Z

Tests done.

Dont know why phpunit show [this line](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/829/files#diff-5d7e38c00b425a2261d717220b240457R235) as not coveraged :(

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-12-20T20:50:51Z

It's not covered because `$configOption` is always thuthy I assume.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-12-20T21:04:29Z

The lines after that line are covered, so `$configOption` isn't always `true`.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-12-20T21:06:03Z

Tests run locally, fail on Travis.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-12-20T21:09:05Z

I'll pull this down and see what happens on my machine.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-12-20T21:11:50Z

Thanks ;)
I run it on Windows. Maybe it is a matter of OS.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-12-20T21:12:12Z

Same here.

fixtures was missing due to my .gitignore....
mea culpa :(

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-12-20T21:22:54Z

Ahh. :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-12-20T21:23:07Z

Travis is happy now ;)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-12-20T21:23:44Z

:ship: lol

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-12-26T11:30:33Z

Done.
Could anyone make a review, please?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-12-28T14:32:25Z

quite a big change, it would be cool if anyone could make a review ;)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-12-28T18:03:18Z

This looks good apart from the very odd text wrapping the the readme. That needs to be reviewed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-12-28T18:07:44Z

>  That needs to be reviewed.

changes applied. please check it now ;)

Mergy mergy?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-12-30T21:18:09Z

No @GrahamCampbell
It is quite big change and there is only one positive opinion so far. Waiting for more.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-12-30T22:17:29Z

lol, ok. I'm just really looking forward to getting the new caching stuff in, and you said that you would deal with that after getting this in.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-12-30T22:48:05Z

deal with *what* after *what* ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-12-30T23:01:15Z

What I was meaning is this is a prerequisite for #873, which is a prerequisite for something I need.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-12-30T23:09:03Z

Now I understand ;)
What about merging #829 (this PR) and #873 at friday ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-12-31T00:07:59Z

Yeh, that would be fine. I'm not massively rushed for them. :)
