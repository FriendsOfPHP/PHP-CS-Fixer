This should be marked as risky.

Could this take adv. from AbstractFunctionReferenceFixer (#31617) ?

Why? Function names (and calling those) is case insensitive

Because you might be replacing other functions of the same name that are just namespaced.

Not sure, that code is useful for finding functions by the name of the function, here I do it the other way around; when a function call is found; check if it should be changed.

that still wouldn't break the code?

I agree with @SpacePossum that it would not change code behavior.
But maybe there would be undesired changes anyway.

But is it "risky"?

even these are case insensitive
