Looks like there are a lot of unrelated commits.

you need to rebase that will clean your commits @keradus

@cordoval yes, i know.
I start using this scheme of actions:
- PR, with one or few commits
- as many commits as needed during review, one per ~issue
- when PR is ready to merge with master - squash all and rebase on master.

I think it works well, look at #471 or #472, which are more bigger changes and lives a lot during discussion.

@fabpot ready ;)

@keradus the issue was that this branch was including totally unrelated commits (there were commits about new fixers in it)
