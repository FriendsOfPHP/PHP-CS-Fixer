From fixer descr:
> PHP multi-line arrays should have a trailing comma.

I would add a comma, and a whitespace if missing:
```php
$a = array(1, 2, 3,
    4, 5, 6);
```
into
```php
$a = array(1, 2, 3,
    4, 5, 6, );
```

I disagree. Isn't the multiline fixer only designed to add commas when there is one element per line?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Can't see that condition in fixer descr.

So you would not add a comma after last element here?
```php
$a = array(
    1, 2, 3,
    4, 5, 6,
    7, 8, 9
);
```
?

Ahh, well that's different. Disregard my previous comment. This is what I'd consider to be correct:

```php
$a = array(
    1, 2, 3,
    4, 5, 6,
    7, 8, 9,
);

$a = array(1, 2, 3,
    4, 5, 6,
    7, 8, 9);
```

Both of these are "ok", but I'd always user the first one. Maybe we need a fixer to get from the second one to the first one?

It is the same! This is a fixer for multiline-array. Each of theme are multiline-arrays! So each should have a comma after last element.
With or without a new fixer you proposed this fixer should do it's job good.

I prefer the behaviour this pull brings.

After this PR we look what fixer is supposed to do (descr) and then we see that it doesn't do it...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-09-29T15:43:31Z

Do you agree that
```php
$a = array(1, 2, 3,
    4, 5, 6,);
```
Is wrong though?

We need to change it to something. Maybe we should add a comma and put the bracket on a new line (ie move the bracket and all content following the bracket)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-09-29T16:52:07Z

If we add a space:
```php
$a = array(1, 2, 3,
    4, 5, 6, );
```
it will be cool for me.

Adding new lines shouldn't be done here - if one want it should be done as separate fixer IMO.

Ok then. That sounds like a plan. :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-09-29T20:39:39Z

@sstok how do you think ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by sstok at 2014-09-30T07:14:55Z

Both are OK with me :) I will update the PR so inserts a space after a comma (when there is no newline before the closing brace)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-09-30T08:33:00Z

great ;)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by sstok at 2014-09-30T11:22:29Z

Done.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by sstok at 2014-09-30T12:16:07Z

Updated.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by sstok at 2014-09-30T12:37:36Z

Updated, should be good now.
