done, please review

What's the status on this please?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This PR looks ok to me. Probably merge this and then see what reports come in. :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Already marked as RTM.
Would be great to finish some other PRs and merge this after that.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Or just merge this first since it's ready. :trollface:

easier to rebase this than fix upcoming code during 1.x->2.x merge.
