@SpacePossum This is once again ready for review

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@BackEndTea if you've the time, could you rebase your branch and add this new fixer to the [.php_cs.dist](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/blob/master/.php_cs.dist) of the project?
(maybe this should go the SF set, btw. is this fixer `risky`, we might change the visibility of a non-PHPUnit test I think?)

> btw. is this fixer `risky`

wow, why it is not marked as risky ?

I have rebased on master, marked the fixer as risky, added it to `.php_cs.dist` and ran the fixer

@keradus @SpacePossum Is this good for the next release, or are there still things that need to be fixed?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@BackEndTea please pull my commits in if you want to keep up working in this.
I think this looks good, but we've to wait for people to find the time to merge and release and such, please be patient with us, busy days! :)

No problem, just wanted to make sure that you weren't waiting for something from my side.
