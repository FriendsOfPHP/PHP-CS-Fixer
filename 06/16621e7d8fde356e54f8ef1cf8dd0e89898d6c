It doesn't actually check that it IS single line?

I think it does, the line break in the regex prevents matching anything with a line break in it.

One file hit on SF, not worth PR'ing IMHO.

Fixer should run after `phpdoc_type_to_var`

No, it should just recognize `@type` as well as `@var` like all the other fixers do?

I don't have need to support non-standard annotation in every single fixer.
Actually, I just don't know what `@type` annotation is, for me it's custom annotation. This fixer follows PSR5 proposal and fixes one of its ยง, which says nothing about `@type`. And custom annotation could means anything, so it's better to not mess with it.

It did when I originally wrote the fixers though.

By that logic, it absolutely must be removed from our tag class then?

No, as we support converting it to proper one if one follows old PSR-5 one day.

Well we can't have one rule for one, and one for another. We need to either change this fixer to deal with `@type`, or rip that stuff out the other fixers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2016-02-15T23:49:28Z

It sounds to me like you want to rip it out of the other fixers, but keep the converting fixer?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2016-02-16T00:04:42Z

I just don't like to propagate fixing that violates PSR-5 proposal

Please @SpacePossum , could you handle non-working Travis ?
