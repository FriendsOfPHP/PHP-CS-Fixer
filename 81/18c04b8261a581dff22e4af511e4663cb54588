Thanks for the review so far all! I'll rework the fixer; check the Tokens from last to first, making it more easy, split it up a bit in some private methods, fix the case were `unset` is used without a semicolon.
I'll comment if it is ready for re-review :)

~~I think I got everything to finish this pretty soon.~~

 What should we call this Fixer? `NoConsecutiveUnsetCallsFixer` ?

maybe sth like `CombineConsecutiveUnsetsFixer` ?

please add some test cases for `unset($arr['key'])` and `unset($obj->foo)` etc.
