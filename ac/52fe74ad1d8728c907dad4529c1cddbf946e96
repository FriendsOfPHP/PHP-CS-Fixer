Ha. I guess the implementation for searching for php from phpdbg doesn't need to be sophisticated. The use case there is so restricted, it could be only the project's own test suite that needs it!

I see no benefits on doing this on tests only.
Same time, I can see benefits when one want to debug tool runtime and during that the tool is freezing.

Ah yes, fair point.

Looks good to me, granted that PHP_SAPI is the best we got for checking exec. env.
(However ATM [appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/keradus/php-cs-fixer/build/dev-3728) seems stalled while happy after last step?)

So, appveyor looks to be frozen
