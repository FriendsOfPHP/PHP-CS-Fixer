the docs doesn't say that method tests both `expoected === fix(input)` and `expected === fix(expected)`

Where would you add this? I just added the note that input should be null if it is intentionally the same.
Would you just have some paragraph above explaining that?

But don't tell why. And that won't protect us for generating tests like `[$exp], [$exp, $inp]`.

Yeah, summary + description would make it!
