@SpacePossum done, you can remove `WIP` label and review ;)

Do want to include https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/issues/4160 and rename the fixer?

Not sure about one fixer for all mockery-will-fixing... its sounds like a good idea to me to be honest but lets see what others think.

In the meantime, please add a PHP7.3 test case with something like
`$someMock->method("someMethod")->will($this->returnValue( 10  ,  ));`

@kubawerlos can you rebase and squash for me? :)
