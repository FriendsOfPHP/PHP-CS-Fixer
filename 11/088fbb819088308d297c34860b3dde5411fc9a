:-1:
I don't want to have 100 fixers on one level.

Instead of it I would prefer to have dirs per type of changes, like dir for PhpDoc fixers, dir for phpunit fixers and so on.

:-1: for this as is

current state: https://github.com/gharlan/PHP-CS-Fixer/tree/remove-level-subdirs/src/Fixer
is this the right direction?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I assume that `*_` are not-moved-yet fixers.
I do very like that direction.

Also, at the end, I would move `FixerInterface` and `Abstract*Fixer` into `Fixer` dir as well.

yes

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

all classes are moved now: https://github.com/gharlan/PHP-CS-Fixer/tree/remove-level-subdirs/src/Fixer
please discuss.. :)

Can we not get away with `Return` rather than `ReturnNotation` since php surely only reserves the class `Return`, not the namespace?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2016-02-14T23:24:58Z

Same for the others, like `Array`.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2016-02-14T23:25:48Z

Could we move the abstract phpdoc fixers into the phpdoc namespace?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm :+1: on the way this PR is moving btw.

Sigh. I guess I didn't think about how tokenization would work.
