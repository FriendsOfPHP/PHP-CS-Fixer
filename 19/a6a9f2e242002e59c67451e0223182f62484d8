nice idea for a fixer :)

:+1: but please move to `symfony` ruleset

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moved.

You don't need to squash the commits. I do it during merging.

Please fix CI.

I think we should use another name instead "no_spaces_between_offset", since this fixer don't removes only spaces between offsets, also the space between an offset and another valid expression. What about "no_offset_surrounding_spaces" or something similar?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2016-07-23T20:29:43Z

what about `no_spaces_outside_offset` ?
or even combine it with `no_spaces_inside_offset` and create options which spaces should be removed, all by default.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Combining both fixers seems to be the better approach, but how can name the resultant fixer? "no_offset_spaces"?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2016-07-23T20:38:29Z

or `no_spaces_around_offset`
I'm fine for both

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If I allow the curly braces syntax for the "inside" fixer, it throws `InvalidArgumentException: Invalid param $startIndex - not a proper block start`. How can I avoid it?

>If I allow the curly braces syntax for the "inside" fixer, it throws InvalidArgumentException: Invalid param $startIndex - not a proper block start. How can I avoid it?

Its because the block type is not added yet to the types for which one can search the end and start. I've added there in this PR: https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/2093

:+1: except minor comment and if green after dep merge

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by SpacePossum at 2016-07-25T07:54:03Z

please update the https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/blob/master/UPGRADE.md as well since the fixer is renamed/replaced.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2016-07-25T07:55:39Z

that was my first thought, but the replaced fixer was introduced on 2.x (even not 1.12), which is not yet released ;)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by SpacePossum at 2016-07-25T07:59:36Z

ha, very well! sorry people, Monday morning Im gonna get some coffee and stop spamming wrong review suggestions ;)

Is there something preventing to merge this PR?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

tested on the following code bases;
- Symfony master, one valid fix
- composer 1.12, zero hits
- Twig 1.x, zero hits
- Silex master, zero hits

I'm :+1: for the current version of this PR, nice fixer @phansys  :)

(On a side note, maybe we should open up a meta ticket to normalize the way we do fixer configuration on 2.x before that one gets released)
