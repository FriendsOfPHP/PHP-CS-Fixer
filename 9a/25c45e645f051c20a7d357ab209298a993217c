Please update the test where the case insensitive sorting changes the expected result

Actually, it is not a failing test. It is the fixer changing something on its own codebase. So please run the fixer on itself once the code is working.
and please add a test ensuring the case insensitive sorting in the future

Can this test be added to the test suite? Anyway I fixed the sort order and added a test case.

In order to make the fabbot test succeed I also fixed the "thru" typo in Transformers.php

Great to fix it ;)

Please do not merge PR with master - it produces ugly merge commit.
Instead just rebase your PR on master.
You may do it now too - it will remove the merge commit.

Then just remember to push with `-f` option
