is there any technical or BC concern for not sending this to 2.15 though?

No, this is a SemVer requirement: backward compatible new features should be added in minor releases, not patch ones.

marked the fixer as risky, see https://3v4l.org/feUVd
I prefer to merge all in one go on 2.15 and be practical. This saves the maintainers/members time when merging, both for the upcoming releases and in the future as the differences between the branches stays smaller.

üëç but I still believe adding a new option should only happen on master though.

`phpmd` in analyzing the fixtures;

```
The command "php -d auto_prepend_file=dev-tools/vendor/autoload.php ./dev-tools/tools/phpstan analyse" exited with 0.
$ if [ -n "$CHANGED_PHP_FILES" ]; then ./dev-tools/vendor/bin/phpmd `echo "$CHANGED_PHP_FILES" | xargs | sed 's/ /,/g'` text phpmd.xml || travis_terminate 1; fi
/home/travis/build/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/tests/Fixtures/Integration/set/@Symfony_whitespaces.test-out.php:110	The class finalClass is not named in CamelCase.
```

this is not what we want I hope?
