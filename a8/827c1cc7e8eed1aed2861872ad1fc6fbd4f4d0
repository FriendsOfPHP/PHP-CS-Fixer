`composer-require-checker` cannot be told to read `autoload-dev` as well it seems :|

it shouldn't load dev, that's the idea of checker. would your project work with only prod-deps

If it doesn't load dev, than it shouldn't check for unknown symbols in the dev folders either I think?

The report is legit: the classes you ported from Gecko package are defined in the `PhpCsFixer\Tests` namespace, which is similar to moving the package back to `require-dev`: it won't be available when using Composer with `--no-dev`.

OK, thanks. This is such a energy-draining issue I take any idea to get it resolved.

Moving the constraints to a namespace in `src/` (with an `@internal` annotation) should be enough.

```
/home/travis/build/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/src/Test/Constraints/XMLMatchesXSDConstraint.php:33	The parameter $XSD is not named in camelCase.
/home/travis/build/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/src/Test/Constraints/XMLMatchesXSDConstraint.php:33	The variable $XSD is not named in camelCase.
```

¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

name it `$xsd`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by SpacePossum at 2018-02-19T10:52:21Z

and class name? `XmlMatchesXsdConstraint` ? can't we white list abbreviations?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2018-02-19T10:56:31Z

abbreviations shall be camelcased properly. like `is HTML` is camel cased into `isHtml`. same for XML and XSD

@SpacePossum , if possible, avoid squashing ;)
or was that just a rebase ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2018-02-19T20:42:43Z

@SpacePossum , I'm getting lost, windows is failing, could you help ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by SpacePossum at 2018-02-20T07:43:02Z

thanks for the debugging @keradus
I'm trying here as well
This is a good example why the gecko has to go, Windows and Mac CI was never setup :(

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

funny thing is that when we use this class in our tests, it works nicely,
it just failing on it's own tests :|

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by julienfalque at 2018-02-20T11:43:05Z

Test fixed :)

@keradus please squash my commit when merging.
