Unrelated(ish), but in addition to this, we need a good way to get all imports per namespace. I noticed you were working on this in a  pull to the unused import fixer. Such a functionality would be useful to reuse if I were to add a fixer to convert fqcns in docblocks to use the short equivalent, if already imported.

It's one thing getting the tokens, but actually working out what they mean takes more lines of code.

are you talking about `Tokens::getImportUseIndexes(true)` ?

@keradus I know `Tokens::getImportUseIndexes(true)` exists, but it's not useful at all. I need something that actually gives the class names, and alias names of all the imports, instead of a list of token indexes.

Both fixers would be duplicating that code, which is why we need a dedicated class or something to deal with that.

So I simply can't see how is this related to that Transformer.

No it's not related. It just reminded me that it needs doing. Shall I create a new issue for that?

Yeah, to not mix subjects.
Please add some examples too.

Looks done now.
Could anyone make a review, please?

Looks good then. :+1:

Thanks!

any thoughts about `CT_USE_TRAIT` and `CT_USE_LAMBDA` names?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-12-28T18:10:27Z

Yeh, they're probably fine.
