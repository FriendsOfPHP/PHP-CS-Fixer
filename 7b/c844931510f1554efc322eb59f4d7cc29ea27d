Rebased.

@keradus In order to remove the duplication, we did have to make a breaking change to a protected property. Is this acceptable?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-11-27T16:41:02Z

Should that change be moved to 2.x?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-11-27T16:50:15Z

Done. :)

I'm good to merge this, but first please could you tell what benefits to DocBlock component this PR will brings?

I'm going to write a fixer to fix `false|bool` to `bool`, and other cases.

Abstracting this code can avoid duplication.

I had some other ideas, but I forgot them now. There were 2 or 3 others though. ;)

We also have actual unit testing over some stuff that was previously assumed to work and backed up by functional tests.

`Token[]|array` -> `array`
`mixed|( ... )` -> `mixed`
?

I meant for other fixers.

But, yeh, those are valid cases for that fixer.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

and anything `|void` is `void`

:+1: (when tests will pass)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-11-27T18:37:29Z

Tests passing. :)

Sorry, I have just a weekend of and can't wait for tests ;) One way or another marked as RTM so... merging :D
