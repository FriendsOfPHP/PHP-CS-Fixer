We really need to add tests that run with multiple fixers. Maybe we need some tests that check the results for entire levels?

I agree it would be really great to have it. Sadly, I won't have time to make them.

I'll make an issue. If nobody has time to do it, I definitely will have time in the summer to do it. :)
