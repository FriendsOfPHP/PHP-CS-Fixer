Thanks @K-Phoen , looks promising! :)

>I targeted the 2.7 branch, but this new reporter can easily be backported to the 2.2 branch (in fact, I already cherry-picked the commits and backported it)

We accept new features on new releases only, so the current target `master` is spot on :+1: , still good to know it would be compat with older versions.

I hope to do good review tomorrow (if work allows it ;) ) !

I updated the PR and rebased against master :)

I rebased against master, is there anything left to do? (except wait for the "official" xsd to be written)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2017-10-10T18:13:23Z

IMO all good
no need to awaits for official xsd, we could switch when they will provide it
