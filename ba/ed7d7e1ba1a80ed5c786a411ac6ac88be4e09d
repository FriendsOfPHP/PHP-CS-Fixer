No point in this. This will only get outdated. The 1.5 branch would have been deleted if it weren't for the fact that github won't let us because there are pulls targeted at it.

@SpacePossum It's not up to me to reject this. You should leave this for @keradus to decide.

Don't like putting version exactly... they will change after each minor releases...
current default branch for features, previous branch for bugfixes, master branch for BC breakers
