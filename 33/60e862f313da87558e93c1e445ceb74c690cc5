Shouldn't we deprecate options that have the wrong casing?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@julienfalque I was under the impression that the deprecation should happen in the master branch not 2.2?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

`trigger_error(E_USER_DEPRECATED, ...` shall not go to 2.2, only master
docs update that option is deprecated could go to 2.2, sure

eventually, both of those changes shall be applied ;)

Ah indeed, deprecations must be merged on master... But if we are to actually deprecate wrong options, shouldn't we avoid giving them visibility via aliases? I mean, aliases give the impression that both names are fine and choice is up to final user.

we shall put stress on that aliased options are deprecated, but one shall not un-document aliased values - as then, one is not able to search for docs of them

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I know. I meant to simply deprecate wrong options like we did for already deprecated one: mark the current ones as `deprecated` in the doc and create the new options that replace them.
