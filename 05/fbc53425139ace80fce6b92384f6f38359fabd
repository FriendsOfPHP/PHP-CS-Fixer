I believe @SpacePossum meant #4468 (which replaced #4469 was fixing).

BTW what was wrong with #4469?

wrongly copy paste indeed, I tried to merge/squash the other one, didn't work out, opened this one but run out of time of merging, will merge later

@SpacePossum any news on this? I had a similar issue like in #4468 and it looks like your PR would fix that.
