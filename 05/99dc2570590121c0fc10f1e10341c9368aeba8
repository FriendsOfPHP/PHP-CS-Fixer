PR should be atomic. You have said that you add a `insensitive` option. But you have add 2nd change here - removing comparision of lines.
Below my comment only for removing comparing the lines.

- `Token::equal` currently may check the line or not - depending on the input parameter. Now you have remove it and line will never be compared. It is a BC break that won't be merged into 1.x.
- If you wan't to change this it should be merged into 2.x, but wait! `Token::line` is already removed in 2.x line!
