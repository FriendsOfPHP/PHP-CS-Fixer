Seems to be ready.

After review commits will be squashed.

Again in WIP status, waiting for #480 (MultipleUse)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@keradus could you rebase this on top of master so that the common which was duplicated in #480 (which has been merged) does not appear in the diff anymore ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Branch rebased on current master)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Very well. It seems to be finished. Start squashing

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-08-26T19:00:34Z

25 commits squashed.
We made biggest fixer here!
I remove WIP flag again.

@GrahamCampbell actually it is a big fixer. @stof have done a great review but rush is not needed here. Maybe sb else want to review it as well. Fixer already has so many testcases, maybe I missed sth

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-08-28T16:45:55Z

Sure.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-08-28T21:12:36Z

(just rebase to resolve conflicts)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2014-08-30T19:12:55Z

@keradus anything preventing the merge ?
