big :-1: for that
This topic is coming back multiple times around phpunit.
Assertions are declared as static methods, indeed. It is due to how they were copy-pasted from JUnit ages ago.
It even happen it's officially documented now: http://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/assertions.html#static-vs-non-static-usage-of-assertion-methods
yet, keep in mind that official docs uses `->` convention everywhere, and most devs are following it. We too.

Is it ok for you to add it to `.php_cs.dist` with fixer configured to `$this->`?

@keradus may we add this to 2.11?

@keradus is anything blocking this PR to be tagged for the next release?

I thought that #3478 shall be merged first.
Shall it ?

PR rebased and fixed with the recent rules.

**Nighlty** fails because I don't know, by I'll not consider it.
**7.2** fails because of the "*exceeded the timeout of 60 seconds*"
https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/3478 now is merged.

> Add to .php_cs.dist with $this-> syntax: only after review

This point is still to be discussed.

Everything else is ok I think.
