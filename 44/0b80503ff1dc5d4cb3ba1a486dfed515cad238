Maybe go with `^5.3.6 || ^7.0 <7.2` or `>=5.3.6 <7.2`?

First, I wanna have `^5.3.6 || ^7.0 <7.2` but it's not working (https://semver.mwl.be/#?package=symfony%2Fsymfony&version=%5E2%20%7C%7C%20%5E3.0%20%3C3.1&minimum-stability=stable)
The later one looks ugly for me, like we would support crappy v6 :/

And what do you think about idea itself ?

:+1: for the idea :)
it would require at least one new release for each new PHP version, even when no changes are needed in the app. Will you also add runtime checks for the PHP version for the phar releases?
