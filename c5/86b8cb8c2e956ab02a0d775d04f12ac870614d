I think the bug is that it is not used?

It should've never been added to the code base as it is not used. I also don't think it is a much wanted feature as no one reported that the option does nothing.

I suppose this is fine for now. The fixer is marked as experimental anyway, so we are free to add/remove/change options and defaults anyway. :)
