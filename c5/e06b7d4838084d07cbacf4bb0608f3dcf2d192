Huh, what? That's not right. Travis runs php-cs-fixer on itself successfully.

If this is a bug fix, it should be targeted at 2.0.

LGTM :)

Other than the target branch, 👍 from me too.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2017-01-27T23:23:57Z

The target can normally be resolved on merge tho.

@GrahamCampbell My bad on that. In the [CONTRIBUTING.md](/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/CONTRIBUTING.md) file I read:
`php php-cs-fixer fix .` <- note the dot is inside the command
instead of
`php php-cs-fixer fix`. <- the dot is not in the command.

Using the dot overide the Finder specified in the .php_cs.dist

I rebased my work against the 2.0 branch.
Sorry for the mistake.

>declare_strict_types must be run before blank_line_after_opening_tag is run.
> Otherwise it will add a new line after the php tag and then add declare(strict_type=1); right after the php tag

Your integration test is not confirming that statement.
Adding only itests, without changing the priority:
https://github.com/keradus/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/23
https://travis-ci.org/keradus/PHP-CS-Fixer/builds/196465517

Nice catch! I fixed it. Thank you.

Indeed, in my integration test I declared the `declare_strict_types` rule before the `blank_line_after_opening_tag` so php-cs-fixer runs the first one before the later and tests passed without requiring to change the order.

When I switch the two fixers and keep the same priority, the test fails so the integration test is good now.

Do you want me to change the name of the file?
From
`declare_strict_types,blank_line_after_opening_tag.test`
to
`blank_line_after_opening_tag,declare_strict_types.test`

Please, could you remove a priority change for a fixer, push it, allow travis to crash, then fix it and push fix again as separated commit ?
remember to temporary disable priority check: https://github.com/keradus/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/23/files#diff-412d2e43a7ea3fbe07029a61789f7aa4R5

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by juliendufresne at 2017-01-30T07:04:16Z

But when I do this, I have to comment a lines checking that priorities are not the same.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2017-01-30T07:10:54Z

feel free to temporary do it to prove that test will fail on fixing part.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by juliendufresne at 2017-01-30T07:34:39Z

I rebased my work:
* the first commit should fail in travis (proof the bug exists)
* the second one should fix the issue

Hope this will be accepted as I am facing lots of issue with this priority bug (and it requires me to run php-cs-fixer twice in order to fix it)

Note: I didn't have to remove the assertion I talked about.

Do you know why the appveyor check is not running for lots and lots PR?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2017-01-30T10:21:20Z

Thanks @juliendufresne  !
Please, take a look at #2483 before we will merge your PR.
Ah, ignore AppVeyor queue busy all the time.
