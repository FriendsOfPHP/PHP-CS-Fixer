Hmmmm, in this context, probably, but I guess it's normally not bothered with because tests are normally in autoload-dev in other projects, but here, they're not separated like that.

Whatever they are autoloaded or not one can still import them himself ;)

Not out of the box though. Someone would have to go out of their way to get that done.

I can't decide. I guess I'm :+1:, but would prefer us to move to a `src` `tests` structure at the top.
