Oops! Didn't catch the memo about not modifying README.rst manually.

Reopening as the change looks valid.

I committed the change to README.rst, which is autogenerated from the readme command. I'm writing up a proper patch now. (plus I PR'd to the wrong branch -- d'oh! Probably helps to read the contribution guidelines first)

That should do it, I'd think.

> I PR'd to the wrong branch

You can edit the PR with the dedicated button next to the title to switch the target branch. Note that you'll need to rebase your chnges to drop commits from 2.15 branch.
