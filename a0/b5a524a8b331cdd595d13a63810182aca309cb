Maybe we should pull in the test cases from #536 too like @keradus suggested over on that pull.

Otherwise, :+1:.

Good idea.

Only this one is actually new the rest was merged from localheinz.
`array("<?php \$x = array(\n /* He */ \n);"),`

And this one `array("<?php \$x = array(\n);"),` is redundant with another test.

@sstok I've added it in both short and long syntax, thanks ;)
I also made some cleanup like removing duplicated tests or move them, more info in commit logs
