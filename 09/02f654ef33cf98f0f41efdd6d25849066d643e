We are **not** dropping them.
On original source, we do have 2 files: `php-cs-fixer` and `src/Resources/phar-stub.php` which are almost the same - difference is registering autoloader from composer or phar map.

This PR unifies files and drop one of them, so phar release will use the same entry point as composer-installed app. in that unified entry point, there are still checks for php versions and error handler registration.
