@kubawerlos why target master and not 2.12 here?

@SpacePossum after all it's a new feature, right? Also I've separated the changes into few commits, so in case of bugfix for the fixer on `2.12` we can cherry-pick the first one.

The changes to the rule/fixer are a nice improvement on the existing logic which would be great to have on 2.12. For that I'm happy to see this in 2.12, but if others think it cannot than fine as well :+1:

I don't see new options, it's not an entire new fixer, I could see this as a "bugfix" (of a "forgotten" edge case) and thus targeting 2.12

@kubawerlos would you mind to retarget to 2.12?
