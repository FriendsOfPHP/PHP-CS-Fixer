So the `cleanup : false` does not work? Or the space between `cleanup` and `:` could be a problem?

Because now there is a warning on Travis:

> `jobs.include.deploy`: deprecated key `skip_cleanup` (not supported in dpl v2, use cleanup)

Maybe its indeed about that space. Not sure. Check travis log for those 2 new tags- first build was executing the cleanup of files and then complain nothing to deploy.
With change picked to this pr, it got the build published.
Maybe its indeed about the space

I tried without the space, lets see if that works, also this should target 2.15 I think?

How can we verify this without having new tag?

> Cleaning up git repository with `git stash --all`. If you need build artifacts for deployment, set `deploy.skip_cleanup: true`. See https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment#Uploading-Files-and-skip_cleanup.
