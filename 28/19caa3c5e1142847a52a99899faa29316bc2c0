Can you point to `2.12` branch?

But this https://github.com/mikey179/vfsStream/pull/174/files should be merged first and packagist should be updated

This is actually not necessary. This is evident because composer succeeded on travis...

This PR should be merged straight away.

This can be used as well as argument to not merge it yet.

I don't see how? Composer succeeding on travis means that there is no 3rd party blocker.

Because composer is succeeding on travis without this change.

Composer 2.0 would be failing though.

Yeah, in [2021](https://github.com/composer/composer/milestones/2.0) ;)

No need to hurry with this one, they will rename repo sooner than Composer 2.0 will be released.

@lolli42 can you rebase this PR on 2.12? if not we can proceed merging https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/4367 as alternative I think

My point is that they don't need to rename the repo. The name is already lowercase, regardless of what they named it in their composer.json. The packagist registry considers is lowercase. This is exactly why there was never a third-party blocker here.
