Rewriting the logic, much cleaner now (no more crazy recursion).

Indeed, looks cleaner now, good job !

@keradus you can do it automatically when merging with the GH tool

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-08-26T18:50:29Z

@stof I see, don't know that tool :(

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@keradus maybe you can ask access or if that is not possible feel free to use Gush which is open source. we can try implementing it there.

@cordoval
If it one presented by Fabien at Warsow year ago then yes, I asked for it. Let give Fabien some time, he just come back and I'm sure he has tons of mails ;)
I already take a quick look at Gush (find out about it reading it's footer on some PR), but so little time to start knowing it

@keradus gush is super simple because is a symfony console app, i bet is very similar to gh since Gush got inspiration from it. However Gush teamed up with bldr-io which is another tool for workflows. So you can find gush bldr block for instance. But yeah, whichever does the job. I know @sstok uses Gush :blush:

@keradus I thought you were using it when merging, given that the commit messages are looking similar to @fabpot's ones, but this is indeed not true for the long description

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@stof just imitate the commitlog to preserve changelog form, no notes are made etc. That's why I merge only single-commit PR.

And we are so far from the fixer itself :D

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by sstok at 2014-08-27T09:22:01Z

squashed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2014-08-28T16:49:36Z

@keradus I think this one can be merged

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by sstok at 2014-08-29T09:19:54Z

Ready for merging :shipit:
