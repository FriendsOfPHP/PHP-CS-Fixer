The reason why your builds keep failing by the way is laid out in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
> Regenerate README: `php php-cs-fixer readme > README.rst`. Do not modify `README.rst` manually!

Hi and thanks for opening this PR.

Before I review the PR in detail, I'm wondering. The suggestion to uppercase the keywords is not in line with [PSR2](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/#25-keywords-and-truefalsenull) , however this is part of the Drupal standard? Do you know why Drupal prefers this style or if this is legacy they might want to move away from?

Hello,

No I don't know why using uppercase for keywords was chosen in Drupal.
I'm pretty sure that it won't change in Drupal 7 and 9 and I don't know either if they are going to move away from it in Drupal 9.
However, I really wish they do.

That said, having this configurable in PHP-CS-Fixer shouldn't be a bad thing, I think.

I'm +1 as this is a standard of a bigger community (Drupal) even if against PSR, however I know of and respect the opinions of people who feel different about this change.

(but the PR itself needs some tweaking still)

Final nitpicking remark from me: I find "syntax" a strange choice for configuration option, "case" or "casing" would be more clear and intuitive.

Ok guys, I will fix this, it will be ready for tomorrow.

(maybe `case` would be best, as we already used that as config option else where, but `casing` we did not)
