This test seems to pass, so does that prove my report is incorrect?

I would say so. If not, please extend your report. Maybe sth is missing

In my case I was subtracting `@PSR2`, not `@PSR1`. I don't know if that should make any difference.

Subtracting set from set with same rule but with diff. config for that rule does not work as expected.
Removing rule from set does work.
Please review!

AppVeyor fail is not related to the changes made in this PR.

After considering all input for reviewers and other members I made a first version of the new code for the set resolving. I know this might not be what everyone wants or expect, however I feel this is the most consistent way of resolving.
This leave the following for this PR
- reviews (please do not request logic changes, that discussion has been done)
- see why some integration tests now fail
- make a call on the release version, is this a bug fix or feature, I can see both sides but lean to bug fix after all
