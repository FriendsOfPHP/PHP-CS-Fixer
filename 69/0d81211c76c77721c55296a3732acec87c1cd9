(but why not leave nightly in with allow fail, then when 7.1 stable is released we will be testing 7.2 beta's and RC's out of the box...)

Little point. I'd recommend just adding in 7.2 in later on when we actually start to care.

exactly
I add it as nightly instead of 7.1 as it was the only option to use 7.1 on travis back there
