Hi, thanks for PR !
please, could you retarget it against 2.2 base branch ?

I have updated your branch with 2.2 to have newest CircleCI config

@keradus It is a big surprise for me that you can write to my branch. But now I see 3 commits there and I do not know if it's okay.

@dg
On the right side of the PR there is a checkbox to (not) allow maintainers to make changes to you work.
Just a little FYI for the future ;)

I see it, great!

From a maintainer side, you even have a button "Update branch" (near "Merge PR") so I could merge base branch (here 2.2) to your branch directly from website.

>  But now I see 3 commits there and I do not know if it's okay.

that's perfectly fine, I will squash them during merging
