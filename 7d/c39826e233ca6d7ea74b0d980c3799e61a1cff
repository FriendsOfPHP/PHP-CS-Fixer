That's weird. Let us try to fix the cause first, symptom later. If we have instability in tests, I want to track it down.
`master` branch is passing on my local machine as well, so it's not only CI.

Upgrade master & deps and try again. If issue still occurs, please provide version of your OS, PHP and PHPUnit.

OK, files from `/priorities/` are loaded in random order.

reason: `testPriorityIntegrationTestFilesAreListedPriorityCases`
it's one test with loop inside instead of test with data provider.

when it hit `markTestIncomplete`, it stops testing rest of the cases

2.2 shall be the target IMO

Rebased on 2.2, where the test doesn't fail. It will fail on master so that must be fixed during merging.

awesome :D
i wanted to be sure that we won't hit this issue again, as we do fixes on 2.2 but don't verify they are fully covered
