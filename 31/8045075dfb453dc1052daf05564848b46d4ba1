Return annotation for `__sleep` method could be removed when https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/5718 is merged.

Other changes looks acceptable to me, but I'm open to sugestions. WDYT @keradus as it was your [idea](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/5689#discussion_r626909103) to make this?
