What is the value of this test (real question)?

I was close to merge 4953, but than spotted this:
https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/4953/files#diff-24535a6889791dd70f4fe486f14c760fR1280

I would like it as autoreview so I don't miss it again.

Not sure that would be spotted: this file *is* a monolithic PHP file (no inline HTML or multiple open tag).

check, I'll update to make sure there is only one named class declaration in the file!

Wondering: this looks like static analysis concerns. Isn't there some PHPStan extension that implements similar checks out there? It not, wouldn't it be better to implement one?

Maybe, there more of there in the same unit test. I think it would be great a stan plugin but till it exists I think it would be nice ti have here in this form.
When I got time I'll look into making a stan plugin :)
