This looks quite nice.

Is LintManager the best name for that namespace?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also, how does this compare performance wise? A bit faster I assume? What about if we're not using linting? Is it a bit slower in that case now?

I can't see a better one, but I'm open for any suggestions.

It does not. No reason to be faster or slower.
The behavior is same as the one on master branch.
If you are not using linter then indeed, the process of fixing goes faster - but it is already possible on master, this PR does not introduce any changes to that.

Issues from review were applied.

Those if statements used to require extra cpu cycles.

It's compensated by implementing new interface and move one of that if into helper method (for event dispatching) ;)

IMO ready for merge.
Any propositions for better namespace name ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

`Linting` `Lint` `Linter`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2015-04-01T11:16:32Z

what about
```
Symfony/CS/Linter/LintException.php
Symfony/CS/Linter/Linter.php
Symfony/CS/Linter/LinterInterface.php
Symfony/CS/Linter/NullLinter.php
```
?

Yeh. :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-04-01T11:22:05Z

Maybe LintingException?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2015-04-01T18:27:16Z

done ;)
