Needs one other test:

```
$this->data = preg_replace('/<\?(?!xml|php)/s', '<?php ',       $this->data);
```

should remain untouched (currently, it replaces the `'<?php'` string to `<?`).

For me it is the same case, and this PR already fix it.
But here you are, I added it ;)

Thanks again for found out this bug !
