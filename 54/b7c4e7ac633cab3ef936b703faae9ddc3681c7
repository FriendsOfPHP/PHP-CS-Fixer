üëç looking good.

What about adding a note to the UPGRADE file? Users may need to update their config file.

About config file - it is not possible to create config file that would pass null to `configure` method, it is possible to have rule conifgured with:
- `true` (will call `configure([])`),
- `false` (won't call method at all) or
- `[ array_content ]` (will call `configure([ array_content ])`).
