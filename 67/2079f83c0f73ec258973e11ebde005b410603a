Why `master`? This isn't a breaking change:

From CONTRIBUTING.md:

> Default branch when adding new features.

The `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is wrong here as the default branch currently is 2.8 (already released as 2.8.0). New features should always be merged in the lowest branch not released yet (master, but could have been 2.9 as well).
