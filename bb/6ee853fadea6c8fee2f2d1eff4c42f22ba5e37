@Wirone thanks for reporting and fixing, looking good!

Could you add your example from https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/issues/5401 as a test to [TernaryOperatorSpacesFixerTest](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/blob/v2.17.3/tests/Fixer/Operator/TernaryOperatorSpacesFixerTest.php) (with `@requires PHP 8.0`) ?
