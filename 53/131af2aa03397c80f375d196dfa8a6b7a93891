Done!

What do you think @fzaninotto @GrahamCampbell @stof @sstok
?

:+1: Nice.

Is renaming this class not a breaking change though?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This class should not be used outside the project.

Indeed, in PHP there is lack of private class or sealed access type

Is the `@internal` annotation allowed a class level. That might be useful to add to such classes so people who are messing about with that stuff know what might break from minor version bumps.

Then we should add it to almost all class. But yeah, why not! Cool! But in separate PR.
It's your idea, wanna do that?

Nice!

But if you also implement a progress bar, which display will be the default in next version? If it's the progress bar, I suggest you wait to merge this PR, otherwise users of the master version will see two changes in the interface instead of one.

I do not plan to add a progress bar like [this](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console/helpers/progressbar.html).

It will be unable to show state of each file like F (fixer) or E (error)
