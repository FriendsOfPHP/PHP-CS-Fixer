Like the idea, changes look good :+1:
you call for help is for finding why the test fails @ travis or is there more work to be done?

Firstly it means I asked for help covering the rest of priority relations, now it means Travis too (Travis is red... AppVeyor is green... :|) ;)

I have removed non-passing test to allow merge the enhanced test method to be merged, and then we will work on that integration test case again.

>I have removed non-passing test

Travis and HHVM don't think so :(

Done.
This is why it is good to have atomic integration-tests.
Bugfix backported to 1.11.x: #1595
