@keradus All those typos were also in commits/pull requests :) Just found one today when looking for something so I fixed also others I found

yeah, I understand that. I am just wondering how to not drop your fixes next time I would regenerate the changelog (which is using, basically, `git log` under the hood)

nice catch @mnabialek , seems I scored 2 out of 4 ;)
I've to leaving this one to @keradus as I don't know about the implications of the (re)generation of this file.
