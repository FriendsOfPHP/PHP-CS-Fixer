What about `die`?

How about `goto` as well?

Not sure about `goto`. We think using it is a bad practice and we don't really want to support it.

Totally agree, and have no intention of using it, either!

I don't mind removing it, let me know!

don't mind about `goto`. if it would not be there, I wouldn't ask for it. But if it's already there, I don't mind keeping it.

I do love our test set :D (no sarcasm here)

Let's keep `goto` then.

having said that, please make tests happy ;)

One of 200k assertions is still failing

@keradus

Fixing it, give me a moment.
