Does this fixer is in conflict with `UnaryOperatorsSpacesFixer` ? `UnaryOperatorsSpacesFixer` fixers also `- 5` => `-5`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I guess so @keradus, should I work with ```getPriority()```?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I added a [new commit](https://github.com/phansys/PHP-CS-Fixer/commit/007101d2c0805255d78462351641ff34f9040ce6) with that change. If it is valid, I'll squash later and backport the same update for #1303.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then I understand it's not a conflicting fixer and `- 5` should be changed into `-5` for Laravel?
Then also please add tests [here](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/blob/1.10/Symfony/CS/Tests/FixerTest.php#L158)

Done @keradus.

Yeah, it's great.
BTW, there is no need to squash it yourself.

Having fixer to ensure there's a least one space feels a bit pointless. Surely we should ensure there's exactly one space.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-07-23T20:42:02Z

That's the use case I'd want from the fixer, and so far, I'm the only one who's said I'd actually use it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-07-23T20:42:28Z

That, is laravel/framework will use this fixer, and we want exactly one space.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@GrahamCampbell, updated.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by phansys at 2015-07-24T00:41:11Z

Updated according your comment @keradus. Please tell me if that is the right way to achive what you suggested.

Please @phansys , could you resolve conflict ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2015-07-26T09:35:49Z

INFO: I will release 1.10 after merge of this PR.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-07-26T09:37:40Z

Can we not just resolve the conflicts?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2015-07-26T09:39:27Z

gh is playing with me during merging conflicted PR, that's why I have asked @phansys to do it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-07-26T09:40:17Z

I would offer to do it, but I'm really busy right now, sorry. If this isn't done by Tuesday, I can do it. :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2015-07-26T09:41:52Z

Fixing it on separate PR isn't a problem, I just want to keep history of original PR. waiting for @phansys isn't a problem.
