Hi @weareoutman ! Nice catch, great the file was not saved to drive as post-fixing linter prevents it ;)
Your PR is well addressed imho, utest that fails without a fix, proper target, nice info what and how! That's pretty nice to see ;)

@SpacePossum , you did the magic in the fixer last time, could you please take a look here ?

Looking into this and digging ever deeper.
Sadly a test like;

```php
<?php false === $a = array();
```

gets "fixed" to:

```php
<?php $a === false = array();
```

which is invalid PHP.
This is the case for both the current situation and for with the proposed changes in this PR.

Hi @weareoutman I found the bug too in another context with weird result:
```diff
 function foo() {
-    foreach ($arr as $key => $value) {
-        uniqid() !== false ? 1 : 2;
+    false !== foreach ($arr as $key => $value) {
+        false !== uniqid() ? 1 : 2;
     }
-    uniqid() !== false ? 1 : 2;
+    uniqid() ? 1 : 2;
 }
```
May you merge https://github.com/weareoutman/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/1 to prove it is fixed too?

@SpacePossum may you merge my https://github.com/weareoutman/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/1 ? @weareoutman seems inactive :\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think @weareoutman is waiting on a reply from the members/maintainers ;)

I just pushed a tweak I made during reviewing and testing. If the tests pass I think this is ready for merging, maybe someone can do a second review.

Thanks @weareoutman for the fix, looking good and my apologies for the wait!

hmmm memory usage has been blown up on CircleCi?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by SpacePossum at 2018-01-26T06:30:32Z

Travis uses [~178MB](https://travis-ci.org/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/jobs/333592604#L880)
appveyor up to [512MB](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/blob/v2.9.1/.appveyor.yml#L26)
CircleCI crashed around [128MB](https://circleci.com/gh/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/2417)
(`PHP Fatal error:  Allowed memory size of 134217728 bytes exhausted`)

I suggest upping CircleCI mem. usage to max. 512MB as well

we already have a linux build on travis, we use CircleCI only for mac so we cover that OS as well in the CI suit
