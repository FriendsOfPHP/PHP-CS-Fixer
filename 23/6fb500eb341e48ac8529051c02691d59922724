Hi @paulhenri-l ,

Could you send this PR to 3.0.0 as it is a BC break?

On the change for the `UnifiedDiffer`: I think here we should use the file info to generate the diff in udiff format with the file info so we create valid patches.

@SpacePossum I'll have a look into that then

@SpacePossum When do you plan on releasing v3 so I have a better idea of the due date on this?

there is no release date planned for v3 and I think we are at least a few months out, so no rush at all!

Hey,

I've made the requested changes and attempted to implement the unified diff output.

Tell me if that is what you were thinking of :)

Hey @SpacePossum this looks good to me, even simpler than my initial implementation üëç
