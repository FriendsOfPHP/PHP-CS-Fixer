Hi!

Thanks for this PR, this is indeed a typo in the docs, well spotted!
Currently on the stable release branch 2.2 this has been corrected by https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/2677 , however it seems that fix was not applied to the master branch.
(ping @keradus , would you want to merge 2.2 -> master, or take a new PR for master?)

This PR and #2677 fix typos in different places.

I checked and it seems #2677 is merged to master

Update:
02339feee54bf8526872394e0e4214151fa95980 is where 2.2 was merged to master

You are absolutely right!
Can't believe I missed the typo again  :|

Nice fix, thanks again :)
