Ok this is not a big deal, but let me show you what happens to us.
`tmp` is too often used everywhere for a temporary file, and in my business we ended up having tons of `tmp` files not cleaned after their use, and we often get stuck in the doubt if we can remove them or not. This happend also with this tool.

I have no preference on what the prefix should be, but we have a bit difficult times when we find untracked orphan `tmp*` files.

May we come to something slightly more verbose than just `tmp`?

aren't tmp files safe to remove, just from their nature?

@keradus this is true only if you consider all the PHP processes as terminated. In our business we use PHP even for long-running scripts.

Then you have the files locked. But indeed, releasing could be messy if process was interrupted.

I'll let the community decide

+1, more clear and I see no drawback from the change

@Slamdunk please squash your commits, I think it is RTM after that.

@Slamdunk please don't squash your commits. It's not needed - if PR has only one autor then commits are automatically squashed during merging.
(Of course if you really want you can squash them on your side, but that's waste of time)

Sorry about that, force of habbit from work I guess.

Teach the people at work that they can squash commits during merging, it's not hard ;)

It would be nice if GitHub could actually support that during merging from the gui.
