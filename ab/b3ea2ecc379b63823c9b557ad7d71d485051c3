We need to remove those extra leading slashes since we don't use FQCNs anywhere else in our phpdoc.

Maybe we should fix those as well. These phpdocs are as much for developers as for test software and therefor should be as complete and explicit as possible IMO.

We'd have to changed everything then. None of our docs use FQCNs.

I suggested the ones that are of value `for test software` as well; with that scope you end up with about 8 places (`@expectedException`).

on the other hand we don't import `LogicException` etc

Hmm, good point. Meh. Fine as it is I guess then. Mergy mergy?
