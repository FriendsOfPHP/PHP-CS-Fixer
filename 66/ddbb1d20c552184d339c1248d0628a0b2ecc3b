thanks for picking this up :+1:  :)
could you update the test (https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/3448/files#diff-c9d2c6319e460e4cee69052c73377d77R339) to show how the sorting is done for PHP 7.1s class constants with visibility?

I took the liberty to rebase the banch to master.
Builds are passing, so if you don't have anything else then I think this can be merged.

Another rebase.
AppVeyor is failing with unrelated errors, other CIs are green.

Could you please merge?
