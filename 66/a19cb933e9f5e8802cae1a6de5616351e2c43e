Thanks for the suggestion!

I think shipping the docs could be handy for people so would like to keep those in. These could be excluded from the `phar` release, but I'm not sure these are in there.

Your right. But those could take up 0.1% of downloads.
e.g. production installations do not need that for sure

I leave it up to you.

docs are out of phar. i would move them away from composer export too.
if one looks for docs, they can go to repo/page/run `describe` command

and docs are like 1.3MB

so, it's 1:1 between core team for now.
@julienfalque @kubawerlos @localheinz , any opinion?

I'm for removing the docs from dist, but isn't breaking links in `README.rst` a problem?

I'm eager to take that risk and see how many folks would complain, if any
