Please mark as break.

@GrahamCampbell looks like the readme command did something strange here?

Please remember about readme regeneration ;)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-12-14T21:43:20Z

The readme was regenerated. I assume I must have messed the line endings or something...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-12-14T21:44:11Z

Wow, readme shows: `Binary file not shown` :D
That's why I didn't saw it first time

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-12-14T21:56:46Z

Wow. It turned out both the line endings and the encoding had changed. Well done windows...

NB. fabbot.io is still failing until my integer fixes are merged into the master from 1.x.

I am working on Win and have no problems, don't know what had you done wrong :(

I will merge it in few moments, just merging what I can into 1.x ;)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@keradus I always work on windows, I still complain about it lol. I'll just have to remember to check the encoding next time. :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-12-14T22:42:16Z

1.x merged into master

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-12-14T22:42:48Z

Great. Will rebase this...

My bad, when not refreshing page the new commits and comments shows, but hooks status not. after refresh everything is good.
