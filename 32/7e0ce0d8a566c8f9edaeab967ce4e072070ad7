First thing - thanks for that !

And now - I work on Windows and want to test it. What do I do? Connect via ssh to my server, fork the repo, install deps, locally merge this PR, run `. benchmark.sh`. Then... My ssh terminal (putty) is closed.
What am I doing wrong ?

@keradus configure putty to not close your session so you can trap the error message that's killing your shell.

 > cannot find php

I have `php56-cli` aliased to `php`
But `which` won't work with alias :/

(btw, `which php56-cli` gave mi `/usr/local/bin/php56-cli`.)
