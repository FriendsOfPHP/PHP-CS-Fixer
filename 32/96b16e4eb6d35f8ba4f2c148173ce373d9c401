what about setting `PHP_CS_FIXER_FUTURE_MODE=1` instead ?

we want non-future to be tested as well, so maybe for one job on maybe like PHP nightly that makes sense?

Was about to say the same, wouldn't using `PHP_CS_FIXER_FUTURE_MODE` change other things we don't want to change in CI builds?

huh? following that reasoning I could say "we want non-udiff differ be tested as well"
but this PR is changing options passed to executing fix command, not tests. non-udiff differ is still tested. same, setting FUTURE env for fix command won't affect tests.

It's not a reasoning but a real question: I have no idea what setting `PHP_CS_FIXER_FUTURE_MODE` really does right now.

Ok I checked and indeed it may be a better alternative, PR updated :)

as in readme, it set udiff and estimating-max by default
