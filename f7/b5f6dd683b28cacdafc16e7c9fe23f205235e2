@SpacePossum please, could you take a deeper look ? I remember once you did sth like this

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by SpacePossum at 2016-03-14T17:45:21Z

cool idea :)
I'm happy to review this in depth.
For one it is missing utest, which brings me to my own PR https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/1654 which will have conflicts on this one. I'll try some stuff :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'll add unit tests

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2016-03-15T19:54:20Z

please don't mention PR number in commits

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ekho at 2016-03-17T08:40:59Z

I fixed all issues and added unit tests

I think that we should not make such a big refactoring in single PR

http://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html
> Refactoring is a controlled technique for improving the design of an existing code base. Its essence is applying a series of small behavior-preserving transformations, each of which "too small to be worth doing".

It's not big.
#1666 is big

Yeh, this is pretty small tbh.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2016-03-17T12:00:20Z

@ekho, a proposal.

I could help you a bit with requested changes.
But if you would like me to help then you will need to wait for #1666 is closed (I can't focus on both at once). So it would delay this PR.

What do you think?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ekho at 2016-03-17T12:40:55Z

@keradus I made changes and squashed commits into single one. Review PR again pls

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2016-03-17T13:09:56Z

> I made changes and squashed commits into single one

Please don't squash commits (it's easier to look at newest changes when you could see only at them, not at everything at once).
Also, please don't refer PR in commit log.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ekho at 2016-03-17T23:37:38Z

@keradus please review my changes

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2016-03-21T09:26:52Z

Needs rebasing. ;)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ekho at 2016-03-22T20:26:36Z

@keradus I pushed ReportBuilder commit here

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2016-03-22T20:49:44Z

Please fix Travis

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2016-03-29T09:37:38Z

I would be nice to have it finished

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ekho at 2016-03-29T09:39:12Z

I will try to find time for it on this week

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2016-03-31T19:38:13Z

@SpacePossum is there anything more that you will need from this PR ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by SpacePossum at 2016-04-01T07:56:24Z

ping @ekho
please consider https://github.com/bankiru/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/2

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by SpacePossum at 2016-04-01T08:11:07Z

Besides the little naming discussion I think https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/1824/files#r57077995 is the last open thing?
This will close https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/1654 as well and a bunch of others.
@ekho please rebase when you have the time :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2016-04-01T08:41:44Z

The naming is last thing.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ekho at 2016-04-02T19:45:38Z

@keradus @SpacePossum all done, plz review again

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2016-04-03T19:50:59Z

@ekho, please, could you rebase on master (not merge) ? Then, squashing consecutive commits of same author would be great.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ekho at 2016-04-06T14:33:30Z

@keradus, done

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ekho at 2016-04-06T15:11:25Z

@keradus , I'll fix it today evening. And I found mistakes in rebasing

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ekho at 2016-04-06T20:46:01Z

@keradus @SpacePossum tabs fixed, mistakes of rebasing too.
