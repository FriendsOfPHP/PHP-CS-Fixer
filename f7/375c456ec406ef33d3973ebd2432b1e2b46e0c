I think that idea itself is nice ;)
what about `space` homoglyphs ? there are few spaces in UTF ;d

I'm was focusing on homoglyphs that you might have in code, so class names or variable names. I think it would be inappropriate to start editing literal strings in code.

The point was to change symbols you might not notice. Given that spaces are not normally part of a name these would be noticeable.

Just having a look, you can put weird spaces in a name, this is valid, but its pretty noticeable.

```php
$replacâ€‰ements = ...;
```
Weird spaces in general, instead of normal spaces, and php cannot parse the file, so I would say its not an issue.
