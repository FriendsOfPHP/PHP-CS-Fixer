@keradus Sorry for the ping, but this bug is messing a lot of my codebase

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is this bug only present on 2.0?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@GrahamCampbell the code of the fixer is the same till 1.9 branch: do I have to rebase against a previous version?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK, read it once again, so...
indeed, does this bug exists on 1.x line too?
@Slamdunk , the fixer may have same code but may using different tokenizer version.

@keradus So, the bug affects `master`, `1.10` and `1.9`. Previous branches are ok.
Do you want me to PR the test in every branch, and then the source fix only in those 3 branches?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

So the fix should be only for lowest brach - 1.9.
Setting correct target for this PR... and done :)

@keradus Sorry I don't understand the consequences of your statement: have I to rebase the PR against `1.9`? Because as of yet github doesn't allow branch target change of a PR.
Should I close it and reopen, or will you manually merge it?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2015-07-21T06:58:01Z

I will auto-merge it to 1.9 line
