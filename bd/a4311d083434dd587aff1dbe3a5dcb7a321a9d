@fabpot, what do you think?

Well, it will need rebasing, and probably squashing to one commit before it can be merged by @fabpot.

Rebasing done, it was needed because of age.
IMO squashing should be done during merging, is it not?

It can be, but then you'll loose your name from the commits because the replacement commit will be under the name of someone else in the git history.

#415 had 3 commit at PR
After merge on master there is:
5e5e63018db138df80c860f7bd41db3072f167d7 - keradus authored, fabpot committed
If #415 had only 1 commit at PR the commit would had only "keradus authored".

Can't see why squashing at PR is better - and IMO atomic commits at PR gives better overview of what and why was done.

It is more important for me if this PR will be merged or not than what name will be see at `git hist`.

And IMO matter of squashing before or during merge is irrelevant for the matter of acceptance this PR.

Sure. This whole squashing thing is a non-issue anyway. It didn't deserve this discussion.
