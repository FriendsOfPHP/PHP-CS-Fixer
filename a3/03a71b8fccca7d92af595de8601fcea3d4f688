`fabbot.io` is false negative because we updated the CS rules of SF set but this is not yet part of `fabbot.io`

+ interesting 7.2 failure https://travis-ci.org/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/jobs/289951049#L697
+ false failure on fabbot.io

too many deprecations perhaps ?

`phpdbg` with `phpunit` coverage runs out of memory, this is a known issue.

obviously phpunit with phpdbg/xdebug demands more memory, yet on master we don't demand that much it crashes the build

and
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46001411/phpdbg-phpunit-throws-error-even-when-memory-limit-is-1

If I run the `phpdbg phpunit` setup local it crashes as well, running with `xdebug phpunit` setup there is no issue. Not sure how to proceed for now.

if we don't get memory issue with phpdbg on master branch and we do on this PR, then I would say this PR requires too much memory. could we check it and shrink it down perhaps ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't think the issue is within this PR, I think this PR just pushes the total amount of memory used over the total limit.

about memory issue.
memory needed by PHPUnit on master: 108MB, on this branch: 108MB

so, it's not about memory in general.
under 7.2:
> Allowed memory size of 1073741824 bytes exhausted

which is 1GB ! new code works ugly on PHP 7.2, maybe some unfinished loop ?
