Hi. please rebase on 2.2

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Targeted 2.2 in #3440.
I made it a separate PR, since not all fixers here are present in 2.2

@keradus @SpacePossum I have moved the discussed test to the misc folder for now, and added it back to the list of caseswithout tests

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2018-01-22T08:27:54Z

@keradus It looks like the appveyor failures are unrelated to my changes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@BackEndTea please note that I've resolved the merge conflict, so please update your local branch if needed

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2018-06-28T07:15:36Z

Let us not merge this one yet, we got no answer for `class_attributes_separation,braces.test`, and for that I want to manually test it

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by SpacePossum at 2018-06-28T07:20:51Z

sure @keradus , I couldn't find a conflict but like hear your findings :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2018-06-28T11:07:33Z

maybe i won't find a thing, simply need to find an hour of calm and double check it

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I found a prio issue after all and created the test.
Also updated the fixer factory for it, rebased, resolved conflicts and squashed.
I know people don't like early squashing but maintaining a PR for 10+ months causes this type of thing.

next time, simply keep single commit for original author's changes, and different commit for your changes - now, impossible to see what was your fix

> I found a prio issue after all and created the test.

ha, I knew we had a prio issue somewhere here ! nice finding !
