Hi @dmvdbrugge and thanks for your PR :)
I like the idea! Could you update the FixerFactory test (in the autoreview namespace) together with adding a priority test fixture to provide a way to test the new priority change?

Please add a test with both a `default` and multiple `case` statements and a test that the default behavior of the fixer is not changed (so no BC break).

Done.

Done.

This was already guaranteed by one of the existing tests, but I extended it so that future changes still guarantee no BC break.

So I guess the state of this PR is "waiting to be mergeable because it's not up-to-date with base"?

Do you want me to merge base in, or rebase on top of it?

You need one more vote of a member/maintainer, but I think you'll get it ;)

Besides that keradus will need some time to merge PR's and make releases. This might take some time based on his agenda as he typically merges a whole bunch of things and releases it all in one go.

Till than, feel free to rebase or merge in the changes from the base (as merge-commits will be removed during the merging of the PR anyway)  :)

Ah, I had not seen that requirement anywhere. Might be an idea to add that to CONTRIBUTING.md? (Or am I just blind?)

> This might take some time based on his agenda

No hurry, just wondering :)

Ok, so I rebased (and again: nice magic)

Thanks for the answers! This is my first time contributing to a repo that has such strict rules ðŸ˜†

it's not hard rule. Like, if thing is trivial, one approval is enough.
If not, we like to have 2 of them.
As ppl are often running PHP CS Fixer blindly, trusting it won't break their code, we want to double check PRs to prevent that happening.

> This is my first time contributing to a repo that has such strict rules

could you elaborate please? what strictness you are referring to? tests in code, 2nd approval, or... ?
