Could we add my other test case as an integration test?

you know that it wasn't needed to use second fixer for this bug right ?

1.11 didn't crash for me on my test case with both fixers enabled.

as it didn't crash for every possible code, i took the one that's causing the issues.

not sure if we want to go for every possible failing case and maintain it...
