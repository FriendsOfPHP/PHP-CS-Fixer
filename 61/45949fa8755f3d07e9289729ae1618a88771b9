Travis failing is unrelated to changes I made, do they need fixing on this PR?

hm... Travis is green for target branch:
https://travis-ci.org/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/branches

The errors are to do with the docblocks that I didn't touch

~ok, on branch check this check is not performed, as file that is causing the error is not modified on last merge into that branch.
probably the issue was introduced directly into 2.2 branch, yet we don't run phpmd on 2.2 line, that's why issue was introduced to 2.2 and detected only on later branch.~

~For that, could you prepare a fix in this PR, and if Travis will be happy, backport it to 2.2 line ?
Thanks !
If you want to go even further, maybe we shall backport phpmd into 2.2 branch as well, but up to you !~

let's try: https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/3531

could any of method replacements to use non-deprecated version could be applied for 2.2 branch ?
