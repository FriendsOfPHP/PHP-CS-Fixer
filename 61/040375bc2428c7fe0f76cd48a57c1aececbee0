I've changed the PR, no it will remove extra blank lines after an opening token and before the related closing token. Checked on SF as well and sure if this is what they want, maybe I should make the before and after token both optional.

I don't understand why github is warning for the conflicts, the commit applies to current master branch without any issue.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2016-09-06T08:37:50Z

maybe your master is outdated ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2016-09-06T08:39:33Z

Actually it's not only github.
both CI are claiming they cannot apply PR patch to master to perform the builds

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

rebased.
