Thanks @keradus, in the future should I group new tests and stuff into one PR?

for cleaning/refactoring, yeah. (for features/bugfixes - nope)
even if this PR will collect other 10 (or so), it will still be smaller than most of the PRs

Updated to test FileReader now, had a fun time with it, not sure if the solution is optimal...

damn. fabbot is wrongly suggesting to fix paths that are excluded in config.
