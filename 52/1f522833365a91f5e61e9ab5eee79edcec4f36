This will surely break most of our fixers?

I ran 1.12 with the default configuration of this project on the sample code and only the `BracesFixer` touched the code. Maybe we should add this case to the SF2 integration test, not sure though..

When I said "this", I was more referring to that style of code, rather than that specific test case.

btw, 1.12 not 1.11? why?

my mistake, I tried and the commit can be picked as is on 1.11 without any problems.
