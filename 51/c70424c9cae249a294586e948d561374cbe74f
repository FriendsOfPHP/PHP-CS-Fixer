@SpacePossum ? Closed?

IMHO this fixer shouldn't be on master in the first place. Using `spaces_after_semicolon` and `extra_empty_lines` will give better results. So I lost my interest beyond the point going through another round of reviews.

Only concerns here were to not break fabpot / PHP 5.3. So nothing big.
So you are saying we don't need this fixer at all?

I think this fixer should be merged with `spaces_after_semicolon`, possible with some config options if one really cares, however I don't have the time.
Test are green now :)

PS. This stops the fixer from breaking stuff, however it would be nice to be tweaked at some point to do;
expected
```php
<?php
echo $a; // test
```
input
```php
<?php
echo $a // test

;
```

currently fixed to
```php
<?php
echo $a // test
;
```

It's good enough then. But I don't think it will be done soon (combining with `spaces_after_semicolon`) as well.

I think it's ready to merge.
