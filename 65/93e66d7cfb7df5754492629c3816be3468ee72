What about `#\R#`?

Even better :)

I'm not against changes proposed here but, if I remember correcly, the current behavior (not supporting `\r`) is on purpose because the syntax is only used on old systems.

The problem is that the current behavior is wrong - fixer cannot leave the code that requires fixing by itself.

Not sure if we left `\r` support in/out by design, or didn't bother trying to fix it because it is only used on older setups as we are talking about before macOS X which was released in 2002.

With the proposed changes in this PR, which users might be effected in a way that we might not want?

@SpacePossum not sure, some that have really old piece of code I guess, I doubt anyone is using `\r` in new code.

Can you propose the fix in the PR in a new commit? I think it will be fine TBH
