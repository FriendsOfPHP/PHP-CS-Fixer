request to add this to the tests, it makes no sense but is valid PHP ;)

```php
<?php
$a = new \stdClass ? $this->a : $this->b;
var_dump($a);
die;
```

```php
foreach (new Collection as $x) {}

$a = [(string) new Foo => 1];
```

we might want to prep. for `??=` as well (https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/1795) ;)

could you give us a valid example with `??=` (as next token)? :)

Nah. Not yet. It's not merged in yet, and we're not testing on PHP 7.1 yet. We should just make a new issue with PHP 7.1 things todo, like we have for 7.0.

@GrahamCampbell please could you create a ticket with 7.1 wishlist and update ticket for 7.0 if needed ?
