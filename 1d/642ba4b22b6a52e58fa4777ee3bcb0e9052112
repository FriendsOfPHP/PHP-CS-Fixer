sorry I made a mess with the readme, it's my first time here and still learning.

@8ctopus can you help me out and rebase and squash your PR? seems the merge tooling has an issue that stops it from squashing automatically

@SpacePossum sorry for the delayed reply, I need to check how to do that without messing the work.

no worries and no rush :)
lemme know how it goes, I can do the squashing manually if you prefer that
