Are you sure this detects all parent calls? Old code would often do `$this->foo();` to call constructor (if inheriting from `Foo`). At least, I've seen some php-src tests do this.

@TazeTSchnitzel Good point. I'll check and fix.

Idea is great (see #768), nice to see it again ;)

Oops, I obviously didn't know about that...

I have done a little review. Just some minors.
Great work so far @mbeccati !

Before further review - please make fabbot and travis happy ;)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by mbeccati at 2015-01-15T19:32:59Z

And they are happy now.

I think I've fixed most of the code review comments. I've dialed back the aggressiveness as well by making sure that constructors are removed if and only if the only thing they do is calling the alternate version.

Please rebase

Travis is not happy ;(

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by mbeccati at 2015-02-05T19:58:14Z

I thought I had checked, but apparently I didn't...

What about https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/970#issuecomment-70123117 ?
