:-1:  as most of the ((F)OSS) project I work on use `$this->`, I also like the current style better. All in all a matter of taste I think ;)

so, let me remind what I referenced into:
1. we are already using self:: and static::, eg in our custom assertions, in which we can't use `$this->`, as our methods are static
2. SCA tools got confused by calling static method on `$this`

would you want it to target `master` or LTS branch ?

I would vote LTS as to have least number of differences between the branches
