@julienfalque it was [this](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/3141#issuecomment-335377036) comment that start me to think we can have this for something useful actually - not only as help for https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/3146.

maybe a nice enhancement could be made in the [RuleSetTest](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/blob/2.7/tests/RuleSetTest.php) to make sure we've no fixers in there that implement the new `DeprecatedFixerInterface`?

I'm planning to do this in https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/3146 - together with testing that fixers implementing `DeprecatedFixerInterface` will trigger deprecation error. Of course after this one is merged.
