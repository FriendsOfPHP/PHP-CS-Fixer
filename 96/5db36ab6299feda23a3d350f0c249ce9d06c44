What about `assertInstanceOf`?

>What about assertInstanceOf?

What about it?
Oh you mean we can fix those as well...  maybe.. hmm lets me check

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO list:
* ~~`assertInfinite`~~
* `assertInstanceOf`
* ~~`assertArrayHasKey`~~

there are more that could be done, but those would be complex so I rather leave it with this set.

Note to self; only the following (and the negative) can be fixed:
```php
$this->assertTrue($a instanceof $b);
$this->assertInstanceOf($b, $a);
```

Oh, now I see your point. I was thinking more about:
```diff
-$this->assertSame($a, get_class($b));
+$this->assertInstanceOf($a, $b);
```

but maybe it's out of scope, what do you think?

@keradus I'm going to try some stuff out, but to be honest I don't think I can work on the instance-cases. It feels a bit odd to draw a line somewhere, but it is about time mostly.
For example I would like to write a fixer to do;
expected
```php
$this->assertSame($a, is_array($b));
```

input
```php
$this->assertTrue($a === is_array($b));
```

etc. Its just its going to take more time than I've got.

Yeah, for sure it's not worth to have the fixer over-complicated.
It was just "nice to have" ;)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's Symfony and not.
No risky fixer should be run by default.
Please exclude it from Symfony level to avoid that.

It might be good to have config options on this one, I've added some PHPUnit 5 only asserts.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by SpacePossum at 2016-03-09T21:34:46Z

Processed feedback and added configuration options. Happy to take more notes and ideas about the default config.

To be done on 2.x line (after this PR will be merged)
- Fixer must run after `no_alias_functions`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2016-03-10T09:46:25Z

Please fix 2 minors and :+1:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by SpacePossum at 2016-03-10T12:18:42Z

done, lets see how the tests do :)
