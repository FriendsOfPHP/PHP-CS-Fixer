:+1: (this should even be done in 1.4 IMO)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

nah, 1.4 is meant to be locked, and was meant to have been released a week ago. We're still waiting for @fabpot to make the release.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

maybe the release process should be altered to allow @keradus to do the release himself, given that @fabpot is not really the maintainer of this repo anymore

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yeh, we discussed this before. @keradus needs to be given admin access to this repo.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

You don't need admin access to be able to create tags and upload release assets. Push access is enough.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yeh, I know. There was some other reason. Also, the main issue is that only @fabpot can upload the phars to the website.

I think 1.5 was the correct branch for this.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lack of admin rights is just an inconvenience.
Can't make a release due to fact that I can not release new phar to sensio server.

1.4 is open only for bugs. The whole regression was already done, no need to break that by merging some refactoring into 1.4.

All other should go into 1.5 or 2.x line.
