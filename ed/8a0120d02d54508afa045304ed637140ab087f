Just tested this: https://github.com/thephpleague/climate/pull/42. Pretty decent results. Note that the move of the use statement was a manual fix made by me in the first file there.

Also, just tested this on symfony 2.3 - symfony/symfony#12993.

Don't like the idea of that kinds you supported here.
No support of constants for example.

Is it really needed to remove whiteline not after docs as you wroted in descr, but between docs and tokens of accepted kinds?

They should be? I'll update docs, and add tests for them too.

It is a symfony coding standard though?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-12-15T19:20:21Z

I thought the standard is to not put empty line after docs - whetever next token is.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-12-15T19:23:40Z

Hmmmm. Not sure, maybe you're right actually. I'll modify it to do that, and run it again on symfony, and see what the results are.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-12-15T19:47:22Z

@keradus You seem to be right. I'll change this.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-12-15T20:20:21Z

@keradus Ready for review now. :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-12-15T20:30:59Z

I assume this will make it into 1.4? It's had pretty good testing - run on symfony and another repo.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-12-15T20:55:56Z

Yes, it is already assigned into 1.4.
I just want no new PR addressed 1.4 except bug fixes - then we will be able to release 1.4

@keradus Done. It worked on symfony, and travis is happy.

Just rebased to check the tests are still passing. No changes made otherwise.

Very well. Then it just need to pass my tests.
