Hi !
This is a nice change indeed :+1:

Please, change target branch for 2.2.
Also, as we kindly ask you in contributing guidelines, don't manually modify the readme file. It's autogenerated from code and you shall change code itself, then autogenerate the readme file.
I expect CIs to fail due to that.

@IanEdington the right place to apply the edit is here:

Sadly, you still need to regenerate the readme and commit it. We found no way to not have readme file included in repo and yet visible in github repo page.
please, run `php php-cs-fixer readme > README.rst` and commit the changes :+1:
