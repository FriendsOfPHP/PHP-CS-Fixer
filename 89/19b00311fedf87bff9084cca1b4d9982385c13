Tagged WIP because I'm not 100% sure I covered all the operator-precedence cases. Also I wonder if there are more complex cases than the unit test cover.
Please let me know!

Please check the PR description, the code-example it gives is wrong (the result, at the very beginning, the diff looks legit).

What about these cases? Are they handled? Do we want to handle them?

```php
array_push(\A\B::$foo, 1);
array_push(static::$foo, 1);
array_push(namespace\A::$foo, 1);
array_push(foo()->bar, 1);
array_push(foo(), 1);
```

I think this is going to be a PHP7 only fixer, dealing with 5.6 is just a pain

not handled, we could, should we?

I think yes. We should accept anything for the first argument.

:+1:  done, however I'm not 100% sure on precedence and such

Anyone who can take a final look at this? I think this is RTM?
