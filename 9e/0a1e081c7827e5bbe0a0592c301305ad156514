It would be great to document `*.test` file structure

>There should be one $fixer for all tests. Now we register built in fixers over and over again.

This and removing the temp file is kind of a problem. PHPUnit has no hooks to share objects between tests, nor does it have a hook to perform the deletion of the temp file when the last test case has run.
The hook that is there `tearDownAfterClass` is static so it is not useful since the temp file location is fetch dynamically.

Pointers about how to approach this are welcome :)

Why name of file can't be static then? Same for fixers table.

while the tests passes, it states:
```
[0Ktravis_time:start:06e52a26
[0K$ phpunit --verbose --coverage-clover build/logs/clover.xml
PHP Strict standards:  Static function Symfony\CS\Tests\AbstractIntegrationTest::getFixturesDir() should not be abstract in /home/travis/build/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/Symfony/CS/Tests/AbstractIntegrationTest.php on line 116
```

is this something to worry about, I don't see why this is wrong, isn't this good use of late static binding?

LSB is good, but in PHP one can not create method, which is both abstract and static.
