This will break PHP 5.3 and 5.4 support because it uses symfony 3 dependencies.

We could easily fix this stuff on PHP 5.3. I'll send a PR.

no, it won't use symfony 3 deps

They dropped support for PHP 5.5.8 and below in that release.

@GrahamCampbell again,  box-project/box2#151
They didn't drop 5.3, if you install project via composer on 5.3 it will work.
They wrongly created phar file (as we did before we added platform to composer.json during building)

Yeh, I know. I'm being a bit :trollface: with my PR to them. It's just to make them aware they messed up.
