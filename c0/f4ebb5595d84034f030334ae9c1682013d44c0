There's still [this issue](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/4493#discussion_r350040138) to be fixed.

How should these cases be translated from long-echo to short-echo tags?

1.
    ```php
    <?php /*comment*/ echo
      1
    ?>
    ```
2.
    ```php
    <?php
      /*comment*/ echo 1
    ?>
    ```
3.
    ```php
    <?php
      /*comment*/
      echo
      1
    ?>
    ```

Right now, they are fixed as:

1.
    ```php
    <?=/*comment*/
      1
    ?>
    ```
2.
    ```php
    <?=/*comment*/ 1
    ?>
    ```
3.
    ```php
    <?=/*comment*/
      1
    ?>
    ```

IMO keeping current behavior is fine.

Ok, so I'll update the code as per @kubawerlos [suggestion](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/4493#discussion_r348714652).

Nope, I can't find a way to implement https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/4493#discussion_r348714652 in a faster/simpler way.

So, unless @kubawerlos sees a way to implement it, IMHO this PR is ready to be merged...

@mlocati Before merging this PR we should squash commits. As there is a commit from @kubawerlos, could you please squash all consecutive commits from same author?
