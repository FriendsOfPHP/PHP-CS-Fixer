Although, shouldn't branch `2.12` be the target?

I think I see this as a new feature rather than a bug fix

In which case it should target master, and get milestone 2.14
It seems however, @SpacePossum disagrees with you

(And I submitted too fast...)

I think I agree with the feature not bug fix approach, also taking into account how some of my previous things were "classified".

it is not exact science,  I'm happy with 2.12, 2.13 and master here TBH

I think I will target `master` instead, forgot 2.13 was the stable

@SpacePossum both agrees and disagrees this to be feature :)
