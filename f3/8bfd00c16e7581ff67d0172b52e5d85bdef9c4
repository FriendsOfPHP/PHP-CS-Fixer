Should we allow the php executable to use to be overwritten with an optional constructor param?

This PR does not provide any new functionality.
It just protect us from situations, where there is no standard PHP executable (eg `php54-cli`).

If we want to add a feature to set php executable then it will be also nice to allow to specify it in config

I was mainly thinking from the perspective of making the code reusable, rather than actually writing the whole config deal, though, I agree that might actually be a good idea.

It's cool when thinking about using PHP CS Fixer as library, but we also need to focus on using as a tool.
