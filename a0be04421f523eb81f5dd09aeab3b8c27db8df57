Is there a PSR-1/2 rule about this? Should this only be done for numeric (integer and float) values?

There are no PSR rule for this, therefore it has level ALL. There are no
PSR rules for any other fixer with level ALL.
Just fill good to use always the same one not equal operator.

PHP has the same operator for strings and numbers. It's not Perl ;)

the other fixers at level ALL are related to the Symfony CS rules (it is a Symfony project initially).

However, I agree with this fixer.

@sstok ``!=`` and ``<>`` are strictly the same in PHP. They are both match to the same token T_IS_NOT_EQUAL
