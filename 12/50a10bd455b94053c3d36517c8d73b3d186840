@keradus I think so, go to https://coveralls.io/github/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/settings > `PULL REQUESTS ALERTS` and enable `LEAVE COMMENTS?`.

@keradus can we try this ‚òùüèº and merge this PR?

I decided to merge the change as-is, to unblock coverage for the project.
I agree that there could be some improvements done (eg collect coverage everywhere, not only on 7.4), but I don't see them blocking the PR - please, if you are able to, help and raise a PR to improve coverage integration / github actions further
