@keradus

Good point, should probably start keeping a changelog!

For reference, I have opened a corresponding issue at https://github.com/localheinz/composer-normalize/issues/92. Let me solve this first for easier review!

Since this is admittedly the first time that I have written a changelog, perhaps you can take a look at https://github.com/localheinz/composer-normalize/pull/94 and let me know if this is good?

I would appreciate it!
