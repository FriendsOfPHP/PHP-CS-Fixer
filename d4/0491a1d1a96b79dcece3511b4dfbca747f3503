Perhaps we should include some test cases with things we don't want changed too, like spaces after braces that are part of if statements.

Also, what about interfaces and traits? Are we supporting them here too?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

yes also traits and interfaces, ill add some tests for those too

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

All should be good now, next round of reviews?

Code itself looks good for me.

Need to do some regression tests on codebase.

So, now is the fun case when PR have multiple authors. Please:
- squash all your commits
- rebase on parent branch to remove that merge commit (so ee53cf277d9b82e78fd2e84a5141581525acdfd9 should be intact, it add content, but 58c6dddeec43ea6a9cc4afe7d7d093cd235b4d1b give us nothing, so we want to get rid of it)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Done

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

You have squashed my ee53cf277d9b82e78fd2e84a5141581525acdfd9 into your commit.
No big deal here ;) Good for me.
