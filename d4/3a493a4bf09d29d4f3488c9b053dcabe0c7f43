I've a hard time trying to figure out why the coverage is reported as being down.

This one? Ignore it, it's a measurement error.

I see, the test first failed but now its green :)
Btw. I'm planning to add more logic to this fixer on the master line to remove semicolons after close braces of control structures as well. I think it would be better to rename it to UseSemiColonFixer than, any thoughts?

`;;` and `if (1) {};` are 2 different cases.
Add new fixer on 1.x line

IMO it should be one fixer, that removes empty statements (`/*nothing*/;`).
It does not matter what kind of statement is before the empty statement (ending with `;` or `}`).
So I would name it `NoEmptyStatementFixer`.

So I would also fix this case with the fixer:

```php
function foo()
{
    ;
}

:+1: for @gharlan
Please, create complex fixer for 1.x line and send PR to remove trivial one for 2.x line.
