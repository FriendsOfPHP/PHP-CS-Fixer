nice in between fix :)
question, wouldn't something like https://github.com/composer/semver help you here?

I don't see how.
We don't need to compare version, `Semver` is not needed for us as well (things like `satisfiedBy`).
We only need to bump a version and see if it exists or not.

Very well :)
I thought it might help as you don't have to parse the version string and up it yourself.
