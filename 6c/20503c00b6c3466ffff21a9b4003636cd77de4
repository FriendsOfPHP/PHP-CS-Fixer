what is the state of this PR?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Waiting for feedback. I don't like to tag people, but maybe it would be useful to get the reporters in here as well (Stof should be back next week I think)

@GrahamCampbell I remember that you play with the fixer on Symfony repo, could you discuss with @SpacePossum and then both of you could get this PR done smooth and shine

Closing as it does not seem to be possible to find a consensuses about this one.

Kindly note @keradus that you might want to move the fixer to contrib (i.e. out of symfony level) as @ symfony they don't agree about the fixer behaviour.

Reopen, will have a deeper look...

I would really like to get this one over with after 4 months of rebasing

I found one last bug and good to go: https://github.com/SpacePossum/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/8

Thanks for checking @keradus and the bug report + test :+1:
reworked.
There are still a few hits on symfony 2.3;

```

I'll see if I PR those or maybe move the fixer to contrib level.

for me it shows only 9 files, and if they are not autogenerated code they should be merged

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ready to merge
