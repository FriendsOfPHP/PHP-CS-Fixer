either I don't get the PSR 5 standard or fabbot is wrong here
(and the Fixer itself as well)

fabbot is wrong, that's all ;)

Hmm, not sure what's going on with the align fixer here.

rebased, squashed and comments processed (still waiting for https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/1486 though ;)  )

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

rebase didn't go a planned, will work on this some more soon.

happy to take more feedback on this one, cause I think it is done :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK, if you think it's done I will try to make some final check-up and test few codebases.
Thanks for update ;)

>hurrah, AppVeyor is dead :/

yea.. no worries, same was with https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/1545 but after some pushing it start working again.. can you trigger it manually (or can I)?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2015-11-26T10:00:20Z

I already did it even before writing about it and it failed again
