Perhaps it makes sense to adjust the `PhpdocOrderFixer` to also take into account a range of other annotations?

I like

- having annotations in a specific order
- having annotations grouped (separated by an empty line)

In other words, make the `PhpdocOrderFixer` configurable!

What do you think?

I think that would be great :)
Do you want to incorporate the work done here in the new fixer into that one or keep those separated? It might be easier to have one to prevent conflicts and make the configuration for the end user more easy... hmm... I might need to give it some more thought though, but it does sound good

Maybe thereâ€™s room for more fixers?

- group annotations
- sort annotations within a group
- sort annotation groups

Personally, I would use all of them!

@julienfalque @keradus @kubawerlos @SpacePossum

I have

- rebased on top of `master`
- added handling of `@coversNothing`
- added handling of `@internal`

and I apologize for the delay.

If you find something else that needs to be addressed, I promise to sort it out quickly!
