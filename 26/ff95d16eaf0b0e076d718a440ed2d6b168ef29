Won't this remove `src/Test/IntegrationCase.php` for example, that is a valid API/endpoint right?

I guess that class should have been marked as `@internal`.

don't think so, it a useful class for authors of 3rd party fixers

that's my goal @SpacePossum
this class is still visible when one install package as library as dependency via composer, but when one install project as CLI app, he doesn't need to have it.
