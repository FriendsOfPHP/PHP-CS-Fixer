Nice !

Could you please add small integration test for 7.1 (like this: https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/blob/1.12/Symfony/CS/Tests/Fixtures/Integration/misc/PHP7.test) ?

I'm not saying to add all 7.1 (which of course would be nice), but at least `iterable`

> Could you please add small integration test for 7.1

Why PHP 7.1. This phpdoc type can be used on any version, the same way `string` is used on PHP 5 even though it can't be type hinted until 7.0, and `mixed` isn't even a real type on any version.

iterable is not only for typedoc.
add `function foo(iterable $bar) {}` in integration test like we did for 7.0 syntax changes.

This fixer change has nothing to do with actual typehints though, so in the interest of keeping this atomic, I shouldn't make an unrelated change.

then this PR would make false sense of feeling we support the iterable, even if we would support it only in doctype. big -1 for that
