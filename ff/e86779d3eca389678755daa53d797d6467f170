@SpacePossum , @localheinz , what would be your opinion? bugfix or feature ?

I like the change very much even though I nearly never use the static calls, I know of some people who prefer those.
My vote however is `feature` or `improvement`. I would not go for `bugfix` as the cases here that are being fixed were never intended to be fixed. So yeah, really nice additional so lets release it in a new minor :)
