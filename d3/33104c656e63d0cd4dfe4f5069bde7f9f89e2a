@Luc45 thanks for the PR and changes, looking good! Thanks for the reviews as well people.
@Luc45 can you maybe squash your commits into one? Let me know, otherwise I can do it later.

@SpacePossum  I have undone the merge and squashed the commits. I'm just not sure how to rebase, if you could do it that would be great.
