What about:
```php
<?php
namespace Foo; /** comment 1 */              /**
 * comment 2
 */
    use Bar;
```
Should we add new line before `use` or before `comment 2` (as it has break line itself)?

I think it would be fine to not fix in that case, sometimes people write stuff we cannot make look better :(
