Hi @hco , thanks for your PR, idea looks interesting indeed.
Before going into details of the code, we need to ensure that format is valid.
please upload schema of this format to `/doc`

@keradus I think Gitlab does not provide a schema :-(

Or would a self-written schema help?

Oh - and thanks for the fast feedback!

as a first step i would suggest you asking gitlab for schema, maybe it's there, but they forgot to publish it, or simply it's published but we can't find it? it happened before ;)

I'm totally up for having a gitlab support, just let us ensure it works the best and it's stable, meaning we have the schema first.

@hco , any update on this ? had you manage to find/ask for gitlab official schema ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by hco at 2019-02-17T18:37:32Z

I asked, but got no response yet. :(

So the current state is that they are pointing me to code climate, which would require us to generate more fields, which are not necessary for supporting gitlab.
In addition, code climate does not currently provide an official schema. Asked them as well.

Anything I can do while we wait?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

No response from Code Climate yet.

I currently think that the only think I could do is write my own schema for GitLab-CI.
Do you think that this would give us more benefit than the existing tests? ðŸ¤”

Do you have other suggestions on what I should do?

The Travis build failure is nothing I need to work on, right?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Done. Thanks for the feedback!

The change did not involve any test, though. I think this is outside of the scope of this PR, but maybe there should be a testcase added for this to the `AbstractReporterTestCase`, right?

If you agree, I can tackle that later aswell.

Thanks for the changes, this PR looks good to me :)

If you've some time for a test for the `AbstractReporterTestCase` please give it a shot. I remember hunting down the not-escaped bug on the previous reporters, so if we can catch it in the future by a test it would great. For me it is not blocking for this PR though.
