>[...] we don't want to get on Symfony. The heredoc one being one of them.

The was proposed to the SF community and accepted here:
https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/17086

so I'm not sure what we could've done more.

> is the conversion of one-line anonymous functions to multiline ones.

This is done by the `braces` fixer, which cannot be configured ATM.
The fixer is following [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md#6-closures) so that is why it ended up in the SF set as default.

Please regen. the [readme](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) (`php php-cs-fixer readme > README.rst`) to make Travis happy.

@fabpot , your further input about `heredoc` is needed to proceed.
Rule was approved and apply on framework repo, so at one point it was accepted. Are you sure to remove it?

lambdas - #2421

I've just changed the configuration of Symfony to exclude it (symfony/symfony@d559e26).

I still think it was a mistake to accept such a change in Symfony.

Then please apply both changes here and regenerate readme, as @SpacePossum asked.
