We need to make sure the fixer order is correct.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are right. I think it should be:
after:
* visibility

before:
* phpdoc_*
* braces
* indentation

Great to have that fixer indeed!

Maybe this method is helpful: https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/blob/master/Symfony/CS/Tokenizer/TokensAnalyzer.php#L39

.. and abstract methods in traits

ready for re-re-re-review

We're missing test cases where a method follows a `use Trait;` statement.

Great.

looks like a lot of great job ;)

@keradus any ideas about what you want with this?
The discussion about the PSR5 doc is without a useful conclusion for this PR (i.e. other fixers have to fixed) and silent for weeks.
Is there any way you would accept this PR with other doc's? Is there anything else to be fixed for this PR?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2015-09-01T10:29:27Z

Indeed, then I would suggest to change

```php
@return array {
    items...
}
```

into
```php
@return array
```

and move that array items description into long method descr.

Then, the build should be green and then we see if everything is ok.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-09-01T10:30:19Z

Yeh, that's what we've already done for the other case in this code base.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-09-01T10:30:33Z

We can change both cases back after we've fixed the other stuff.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-09-01T10:31:15Z

Also, we might want to add tests to the other phpdoc fixers to check they work with this nested stuff. I have my doubts about many of them, though, I can probably fix those cases when I fix the other stuff.

done, all green \o/
