What about using `@phpstan-ignore-line` in other places, especially those we know PHPStan did not understood?

this place is tricky, because the error is different depends on branch (CODENAME is always empty or always provided)
for other places, I'm fine with both approaches. maybe a +0 for single file with exclusions, as it's showing the amount of "issues" we have
