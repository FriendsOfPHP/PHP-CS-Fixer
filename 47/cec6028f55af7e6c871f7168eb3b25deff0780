You should also lower case the first letter too then, because it's not a sentence.

not all people write English only, so the rule doesn't always apply.

First word might be the name of class, constant, acronym, etc., you can not safely change case of the first letter.

Don't make the first word that then. I never do that because of that that exact issue. Allow me to have correctly formatted sentences.

you can make an issue out of every new fixer and/or configuration option you don't want, but since no one forces you to use it, what is the point?

@GrahamCampbell if you want to put sentence to param description it is great ! Don't use the fixer that force you to not have it ;)
