from [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Whoops, my bad - didn't read CONTRIBUTING.md before creating this PR.
My commit message is wrong - I haven't removed it but replaced it with its equivalent.

Closing this PR, I'll open a new one

You don't have to close it, you can update it with pushing another commit to your `patch-1` branch.
