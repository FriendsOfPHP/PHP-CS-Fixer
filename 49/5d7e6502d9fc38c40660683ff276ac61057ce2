The remaining test failure seems to be related to the fact that WhitespacyCommentTransformer is not part of the 1.7 codebase.

@keradus we have a warning in the testsuite related to the LintManager here.

Please, get rid of that merge commits, eg by rebasing.
Also, there are multiple authors, could you do the squashing manually?

This will be a problem on our 2.0 line. After this PR will be merged I will merge 1.7 into master, then disable that new tests, and then send a PR for master with enabling the tests again, this way the 2.0 won't be always broken on Travis and we will have a PR to work on fixing token collection corruption on 2.0.

@keradus should we really squash commits refactoring the different fixers ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why not? If they where all yours then they will be squashed automatically during gh merge command.
After squashing we will have case that is already often - one person send a commit that proves bug and the other one send a commit that fixes it.

Do you plan to do sth more in this PR ?
I am asking in WIP flag context.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2015-04-14T07:50:58Z

@keradus no. Given that tests are passing, this is not WIP anymore. I removed the flag
