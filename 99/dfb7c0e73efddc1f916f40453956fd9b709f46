Not sure if I personally agree to this, but if this is what's wanted, it's a bc-break so it has to target `3.0` not `master`.

Changing default configuration of rule is BC breaker indeed, @dmvdbrugge , good spot :+1:

Sadly, I see sth wrong happen with this branch - I see lot of not related changes in diff.

Probably because he just targeted the other branch, instead of rebasing first

It also shows @keradus that you have not yet merged the 2.13 release into 3.0

I tried the "change base" button provided by GitHub, but it doesn't rebase automatically. This is fixed now.
