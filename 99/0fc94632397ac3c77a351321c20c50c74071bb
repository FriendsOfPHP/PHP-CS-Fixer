There's a difference between "no extra" (meaning at most 1) or "no" (meaning 0).

I'd be for combining the ones pointed out into a single fixer (just like the `blank_line_before_statement`), however think that it should be a new one. (With the deprecations ofc.)

if I expect 0 than 1 is `extra` to me

But how are you going to configure where you expect zero and where one? Sounds like configuration hell. I for one, wouldn't want `NoBlankLinesBeforeNamespaceFixer` while I do want the others.

Okay, as there obviously going to be discussion about new fixer to remove blank lines let's focus here about fixing the bugs only.
