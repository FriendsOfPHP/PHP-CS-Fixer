:+1: works perfect.

Btw php.net mentions that `many crc32 checksums will result in negative integers on 32bit platforms.`
You can solve this by using `hash('crc32b', $code)` instead.

About negative integers - IMO it is not a big deal for us. We compare if one hash equals second one.
Don't care if hash is positive or not.
