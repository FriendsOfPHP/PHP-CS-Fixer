@localheinz sorry for messing this up :(
This is an early opening PR since when it tried to find the problem based on your findings I ran into an `out range exception`, so not a false-positive fix. I've to dig a bit more to see if there is another cause.

If you have the time, could you retest the fixer with the changes in this PR on your code that was fixed incorrectly?

A lot of nice celanup, but thanks to them I lost what part is actually a bugfix and what only cleanup
