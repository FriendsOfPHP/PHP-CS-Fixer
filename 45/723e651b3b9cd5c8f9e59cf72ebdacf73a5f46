AbstractFixer is a base for all fixers. And only two need what you moved to it.
It shouldn't be done that way.

Sadly, we can't use traits here (we support 5.3).
Please consider to create a middle-level abstract class as a base for only that 2 fixers or make that code some kind of helpers.
I think the second option is better, but don't have strong arguments for that

See no place for helper like that. Maybe create sth like `AbstractAlignFixer extends AbstractFixer` ?

It would be cool to have one place for all Fixer about stuff, and one place for all Fixers, but namespace like `Symfony\CS\Fixer\Fixers\PSR2` won't be good :(
