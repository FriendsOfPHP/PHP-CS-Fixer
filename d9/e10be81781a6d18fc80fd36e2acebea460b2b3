Yes -- this is a step in the right direction, and makes it operate more similarly to PHPUnit. I want to be clear that it addresses only a symptom -- but at the same time, it will make it so that Travis will be able to complete the CS checks.

Yes, this do not change performance.
After each new fixer performance will decrease - just because there are more things to do.

You may enable cache in your projects in [`.php_cs` file](https://github.com/fabpot/PHP-CS-Fixer/blob/master/Symfony/CS/Config/Config.php#L51)

so just to true and that is it or it needs more configuration? however cache will be of no use in travis right?

Correct -- cache will be useless in Travis.

Yes, just set it to true.

If sb really want to he may add `.php_cs.cache` to repo. Then Travis will check only that changes, that was not checked by user.
