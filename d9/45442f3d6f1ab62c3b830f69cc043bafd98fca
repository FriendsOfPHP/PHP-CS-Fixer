@dmvdbrugge , @kubawerlos ,

are this and #4035 PRs handling the very same issue? how shall we proceed on those two ?

Seems to me like they could live together, they don't even touch the same files. They also solve a problem that looks the same but is not entirely equal, even though it could result in the same outcome.

My suggestion would be just merge both.

I'd like them both to be merged as well.

Reading them again it got me thinking why `Line::isTheStart` checks if `false !== strpos($this->content, '/**');`? Wouldn't make more sense to check if it is `0`?

> Wouldn't make more sense to check if it is `0`?

Can't because of whitespace, I think. Could make it a regex though.

I hadn't even looked into the `Line` class itself, but now you caused me to ðŸ˜‰and I see that `containsUsefulContent` excludes start and end lines, which it should not (because as we both discovered, start and end lines actually could contain useful content). Shall I fix that in this PR too?

@dmvdbrugge I allowed myself to rebase your work to fix a conflict. I also rewrote test cases in `AnnotationTest` to make them easier to read. For me this can be merged now.
