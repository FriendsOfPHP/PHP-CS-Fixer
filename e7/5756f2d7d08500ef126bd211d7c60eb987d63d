Any chance to have this fixer for `v1.11`?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2015-11-12T21:56:01Z

ping

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-11-14T11:15:08Z

@keradus Done. Also, see https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/1503.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-11-26T19:55:18Z

Just updated to match the psr0 changes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2015-12-06T22:51:17Z

In some discussion you were talking about changing this fixer to have one fixer renaming the class and other handling namespace.
Could you take care of it here?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-12-06T23:02:39Z

Yes, sure. ;)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2015-12-06T23:03:10Z

That would be great.
Also, any chances to have it send to 1.12 line ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-12-06T23:03:36Z

What exactly do you want sending to 1.12?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2015-12-06T23:04:48Z

New fixers for name and namespace. And then remove old PSR0 fixer on 2.x line (since it will be replaced with new fixers)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-12-06T23:05:54Z

Ok, right. Makes sense.

Honestly, I can't really be bothered to target 1.12 too.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2015-12-22T15:50:38Z

Actually I was mentioning this:
https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/1489#issuecomment-162358526

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-12-22T16:00:06Z

Yeh, I'd be able to do that stuff on the master branch, and remove the psr0 fixer.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-12-31T16:39:40Z

Going to hold off until https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/1621 is done.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-12-31T16:39:53Z

It'll ultimately save us all time.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2015-12-31T16:41:00Z

#1621 should be green on all CI now.
Will wait for it and merge, if not today then tomorrow. So feel free to just rebase your work on top of it

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-12-31T18:43:07Z

Rebased this. Will work on doing the multiple fixer refactor in a bit.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2016-01-12T23:48:17Z

is there anything left here @GrahamCampbell  ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@GrahamCampbell ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

> @GrahamCampbell ?

Sorry, I've been totally swamped in stuff to do, and still am atm.

> is there anything left here @GrahamCampbell ?

Yes, if you wanted the psr0/4 fixes splitting into two atomic fixers.

I hope to be able to get to this PR tomorrow or Sunday.

Great to hear !

(btw, I will be offline this weekend)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'll have to push it back till next weekend. Being a student, I can't really prioritize it above my degree work.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2016-01-24T19:46:12Z

it's not that big as master thesis ;)

Not yet. ;)

I'll rebase this again shortly. Eventually, I'll work on the changes we actually want here so we can merge this, lol.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by TomasVotruba at 2016-03-08T17:17:52Z

Any help needed here?

I might resend rebased PR if needed. If that's all that needs to be done here.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2016-03-08T17:36:53Z

No, it doesn't need rebasing.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2016-03-08T17:37:14Z

It needs rewriting so we don't have psr0/4 as described above.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by TomasVotruba at 2016-03-08T19:07:29Z

So the goal is to remove psr0 features from this fixer?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2016-03-08T19:36:02Z

No.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by SpacePossum at 2016-03-08T19:45:40Z

@TomasVotruba thanks for offering to help out :)
This PR needs a bit of work aside of rebasing. The goal is not to replace or remove the PSR 0 fixer, however that one will be removed from the default set of Symfony fixers.
The are few things that need to be done here; one is to split the logic of renaming the class and fixing the namespace.
Another thing to do would be to deal with classes that are placed in such a way that when these are `fixed` the namespace would become invalid, for example if classes are located in a folder named `array`.
That is as far as I understand it, but I might be wrong. Maybe some others could correct me or elaborate more about the todo's of this PR so guessing is no longer needed :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2016-03-08T23:36:11Z

I'll try and squeeze in the time to fix this at the weekend.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2016-03-08T23:36:22Z

It's not too far off now after my previous refactor.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by TomasVotruba at 2016-03-08T23:42:52Z

@GrahamCampbell That would be great. Hope you'll find the time to manage all your priorities.

Yeh, I really need to get this done. I'll see if I can do it tonight.

Really great to hear!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2016-03-30T19:45:53Z

Sorry, got caught up with something else. I'm going to try to get this done tomorrow instead.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2016-04-01T15:15:21Z

PSR0 handle name + namespace
PSR4 handle name + namespace

Is name handled always in same manner?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2016-04-01T15:21:24Z

Well, not quite. I'm wondering if we need to separate these two tbh.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2016-04-01T15:21:44Z

PSR4 and PSR0 have slightly different rules about what an underscore means I think.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2016-04-01T15:30:03Z

I see. Thank you for handling the PR.

Please, could anyone review this ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
