ping @SpacePossum , @brendt can you take a look?

@brendt, can you also test it manually before we would merge it?

Looking good. I was wondering, can this fixing been done when not using the configuration option `ensure_fully_multiline` ?
This way it would always fix;
```php
<?php
if (true) {
    execute(
        $foo,
        $bar
        );
}
```

I tested this PR, and it seems to work as intended. Any idea when this will be merged and tagged?

Seems to be working fine on my side as weel, however, this needs a rebase.
