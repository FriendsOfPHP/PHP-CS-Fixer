Looks good üëç but shouldn't the fixer check whether `get_called_class` is called from inside a class?

from the issue description;

```
There is a small difference in behavior when calling "get_called_class" vs. using "static::class" outside of a class. Since this use case doesn't make sense and triggers a warning anyway I think it is not worth the trouble detecting if call is outside of a class.
```

for me it is like using `__CLASS__` outside a class scope;
it doesn't work, triggers a warning, it is a mess, I don't think we've to reproduce that mess using different code or prevent/stop changing one mess into another.
