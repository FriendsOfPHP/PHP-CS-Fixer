This would be less confusing :+1:. Can I suggest that we change `Contrib` to `All` after this goes though?

Change ALL_LEVEL to SYMFONY_LEVEL is done because ALL_LEVEL is misleading - it not use all fixers!
Using the same argue I am against rename CONTRIB_LEVEL to ALL_LEVEL. CONTRIB_LEVEL won't run all fixers, even more - you can't set CONTRIB_LEVEL as console option.
If you want to discuss about renaming CONTRIB_LEVEL please create separate thread for it.
