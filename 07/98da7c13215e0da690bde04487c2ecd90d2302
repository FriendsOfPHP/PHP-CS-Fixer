The main part is there.

What's missing is integration tests (for priority fixes) and apply the tool for codebase (actually, tests folder only)

nice idea :)

~~do you think of having the configuration option `non-type-only => true` would be of value, it seems the SF community tends to move that way~~ ignore

what do you mean by `non-type-only` ?
`'only_untyped' => true` will make fixer to add annotation for parameters that are not typed in prototype

I meant the exact thing you described, thanks! : )

Thanks for review @SpacePossum , I think it's ready now. Please, could you take a look again ?

btw. tests are failing.
Don't we have a fixer to sort `@params` to match the order of params as defined but the function/method signature?

Not yet, but this is natural direction after this one is released ;)
The issue is that first we need to fix bug in our DocBlock module...
