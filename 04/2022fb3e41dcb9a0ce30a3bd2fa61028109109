:+1: but i'd prefer this to go into 1.5. It's not a bug fix, and is excluded from the actual release downloads.

@GrahamCampbell The goal is to have it for people reading the online doc in the right way, i.e. for the same version than the code they are using.

@stof The 1.4 branch will be deleted shortly.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

There will never be a 1.4.1 release. Only 1.4.0 and 1.5.0.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@GrahamCampbell this does not prevent people from reading the doc for the 1.4.0 tag

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yeh, but 1.4 is meant to be closed for cosmetic changes like this.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Infact, most people will fall into the trap of reading the master branch and think it applies to 1.3...

If there were some bug etc in docs - yeah, merge it into 1.4.
Here - it... may be consider as bug, currently one switch to old version (tagged or not), and have a link for files at master.

It's not a feature or refactoring, just fixing docs, no regression needed.
Set milestone as 1.4

:+1:
