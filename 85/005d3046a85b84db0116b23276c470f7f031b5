Shouldn't we add tests for the function when we're passing 2 parameters too?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

What for? We don't care if there is any argument at all ;)

@GrahamCampbell Do you mean `a(join())`?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-11-27T21:46:55Z

No, I mean `join(a, b)` to make sure its being converted correctly.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@GrahamCampbell I tend to agree with @keradus .

The replacement is done at T_STRING token, so it really does not matter what comes after in the parameters.

@GrahamCampbell I see no point in it but also have no strong argue against it. it costs nothing, added.

@dericofilho btw nice case, added

This looks pretty simple, and good to go. Any chance this will make it into 1.2?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-11-27T21:55:46Z

I hope for see release 1.2 soon. Already asked @fabien for it.

I don't want to add new features on `@dev` that would be immediately spread into `@stable`.
New features on `@dev` should have time to be tested by dev-users before releasing as `@stable`.
We are relying here on `T_STRING` and there could be a lot of fancy cases...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

And, we still didn't decided about the level (See #769)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-11-27T22:31:23Z

Sure.

The coronate operator `.` does not seem to be tested.
`'join'.'me'`
