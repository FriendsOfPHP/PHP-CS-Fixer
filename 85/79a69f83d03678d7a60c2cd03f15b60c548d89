I don't think I've the time needed to fix this soon, as it will take me a long time as I find the fixer hard. Sorry about that.

Sure, just asking about state, so we know what we stay on ;)

I took out the other failing test because it is a different issue that should be handled in another PR.
This PR should fix the problem with "\n" vs. "\r\n" endings
