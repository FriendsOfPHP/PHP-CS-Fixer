Hi @siad007 ! Very first - big thanks for support on this topic! Looks promising, indeed!

Sadly, for PHP CS Fixer, the whole point of using CircleCI is to run tests on MacOS (same as we use Travis for Linux and AppVeyor for Windows)

While using docker image instead of build php using brew on host OS directly, we are not testing on MacOS anymore:
```
ker@dus:/tmp Î» docker run -it --rm circleci/php:7.2 php -r "print_r(posix_uname()['sysname']);"
Linux
```

Can you update your PR please? thanks !

@keradus No problem it would be easy to rewrite this to go by brew as it was before - but still interesting enough that tests were failing! I will change it to mac asap.

@siad007 can you also add an entry `.circleci/ export-ignore` to `.gitattributes` file?

@keradus @kubawerlos added your changes right now and it seems ok. But do you have an idea why the former linux based config produced the test failures?

@siad007 in `.circleci/config.yml` in line 22 there are trailing whitespaces.
