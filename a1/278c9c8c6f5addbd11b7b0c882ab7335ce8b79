Well, you've just dumped a return infront of the previous code, which I assume you were aware, and that if statement is pretty pumped up right now - not so pretty, or maintainable.

Yes, that if statement is hard to read and maintenance. I am aware of that and therefore I added a lot of comments in whole BracesFixer class.

But remember this case itself is very ugly:
```php
function mixedComplex()
{
    $a = ${"b{$foo}"}->{"a{$c->{\'foo-bar\'}()}d"}();
}
```

If you can come up with cleaner solution be my guest! ;)

Even just abstracting them to separate methods with descriptions might help.

I'm keen to get this merged though. :)

Actually I don't get what you want to abstract here.

I was offline this weekend.

Move each line of the if statement to a separate function. Now I look at it again, I don't see the point now since we've got quite a few variables about. We really need a better way to do this though.

The commit you just pushed looks good. :)
