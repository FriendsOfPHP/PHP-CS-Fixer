if ordering by version is unimportant for us, we could use this matrix (fastest and most interesting builds first):

```yml
matrix:
    fast_finish: true
    include:
        - php: hhvm
        - php: 7.0
        - php: 7.0
          env: SYMFONY_VERSION="~2.8"
        - php: 5.3
          env: 'COMPOSER_FLAGS="--prefer-stable --prefer-lowest"'
        - php: 5.4
        - php: 5.5
        - php: 5.6
```

putting slowest jobs at the end is nightmare - it causes whole build to be slow.

My main goal: get faster result when a build is failing, because then I have to change something in my pr.
And a second goal: get a faster tendency. When hhvm, 7.0 and 5.3 are passing, there is a good chance that whole build will pass. So I prefer my second proposal.

Or this one:

```yml
matrix:
    fast_finish: true
    include:
        - php: 5.3
          env: 'COMPOSER_FLAGS="--prefer-stable --prefer-lowest"'
        - php: 7.0
        - php: hhvm
        - php: 5.4
        - php: 5.5
        - php: 5.6
        - php: 7.0
          env: SYMFONY_VERSION="~2.8"
```

I don't think what we have needs changing.

Ok. @keradus your comment was a :-1:, right?
Then we can close it ;)

I'm :-1: for flip-flop the order as you done in commit.
But I'm **not** :-1: for changing the order, eg only move 7.0 on top (but I'm not :+1: for that neither, just Â±0 ;) )

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by gharlan at 2015-12-18T13:06:23Z

(updated to my current proposal..)

any other thoughts?
