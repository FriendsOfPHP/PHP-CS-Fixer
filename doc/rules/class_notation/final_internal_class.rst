=============================
Rule ``final_internal_class``
=============================

Internal classes should be ``final``.

.. warning:: Using this rule is risky.

   Changing classes to ``final`` might cause code execution to break.

Configuration
-------------

``annotation_include``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Class level annotations tags that must be set in order to fix the class. (case
insensitive)

.. note:: The previous name of this option was ``annotation-white-list`` but it is now deprecated and will be removed on next major version.

Allowed types: ``array``

Default value: ``['@internal']``

``annotation_exclude``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Class level annotations tags that must be omitted to fix the class, even if all
of the white list ones are used as well. (case insensitive)

.. note:: The previous name of this option was ``annotation-black-list`` but it is now deprecated and will be removed on next major version.

Allowed types: ``array``

Default value: ``['@final', '@Entity', '@ORM\\Entity', '@ORM\\Mapping\\Entity', '@Mapping\\Entity']``

``consider_absent_docblock_as_internal_class``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Should classes without any DocBlock be fixed to final?

.. note:: The previous name of this option was ``consider-absent-docblock-as-internal-class`` but it is now deprecated and will be removed on next major version.

Allowed types: ``bool``

Default value: ``false``
