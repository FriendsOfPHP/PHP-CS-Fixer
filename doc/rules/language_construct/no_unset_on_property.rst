=============================
Rule ``no_unset_on_property``
=============================

Properties should be set to ``null`` instead of using ``unset``.

.. warning:: Using this rule is risky.

   Risky when relying on attributes to be removed using ``unset`` rather than be
   set to ``null``. Changing variables to ``null`` instead of unsetting means
   these still show up when looping over class variables and reference
   properties remain unbroken. With PHP 7.4, this rule might introduce ``null``
   assignments to properties whose type declaration does not allow it.
