would you mind to share reasoning for a person who is not using Doctrine daily?

Doctrine has two object mapping packages: ORM for relational DB and ODM document-oriented DB.
ORM works with entities, ODM works with documents.
Both can't be final because they can be proxied (will be created proxy classes extends them).
Since FinalClassFixer already excluded entities, I assumed it would be logical to also exclude documents.

`@Document` seems a bit generic: shouldn't it be `@ODM\Document`?

Added `@ODM\Document`
