@kubawerlos thank you very much for the review.
Just note that I stole almost 90% of the code from [PhpUnitTestAnnotationFixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/blob/v2.12.2/src/Fixer/PhpUnit/PhpUnitTestAnnotationFixer.php) so all your feedback should be addressed there too, and I don't know if I should fix there too or open another PR.

@Slamdunk I think no need to fix it here - maybe in separate PR it's worth to give try to initialize this fixer in `PhpUnitTestAnnotationFixer` and proxy the fixing.
