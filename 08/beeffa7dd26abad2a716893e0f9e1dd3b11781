Merging things to master started tooking me like half an hour :(

BTW, it would be so nice to test the console output :D

I think we need to hurry up and release 2.0.0 so you don't need to merge stuff all the time. Can we make 1.12 the last 1.x series?

oh no :(
you want me to prep it? there is no rush getting to master..

>BTW, it would be so nice to test the console output :D

that should be do-able (and even more important when we split stdout to/and stderr), lets see. .. .. ;)

@SpacePossum
it's already there.
yep, Symfony has that kind of tests ;)

@GrahamCampbell
This is the idea. This is why I am pushing some refactoring changes lately (eg pinging SpacePossum on things like that instead of new and new fixers).

Or didn't want to start refactoring whole codebase to work async ;P
