I don't like this.
I often store cache in CI cache and use it across all PHP versions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, that's surely incorrect, because the behaviour of fixing a file on php 7 in php-cs-fixer is not the same as fixing on php 5.3.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

And 5.5.1 vs 5.5.2 is the same.
PHP7 is totally different case

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2016-01-01T21:47:12Z

Well, php 5.5.2 vs 5.5.1 might be different if some of them had a bug affecting it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the very least could we consider the major and minor versions, but not patch?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm not against it, just say don't like it in current form ;)

Let the others say their opinion ;)

Like the idea :+1:
Maybe use `PHP_VERSION_ID` over `PHP_VERSION`, it would take out out the extra bit (like RC etc.) I think?

We want that extra part though, because RC1 !== RC2.

BTW, having tests would be great ;)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2016-01-19T10:49:27Z

Any other thoughts?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2016-01-30T15:42:32Z

Anyone ?

Maybe a better way might be to select a cache file based on the php version?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2016-01-30T19:20:09Z

one can already choose non-default filename for cache file

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2016-01-30T19:24:24Z

I was meaning that php-cs-fixer could suffix that name with the php version.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2016-01-30T19:24:37Z

To allow easy cashing across different php versions automatically.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2016-01-31T11:52:00Z

OK, sounds interesting

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2016-02-24T11:12:03Z

Just rebased this, but don't have time to do much else with it, so if you don't like it as is, feel free to just close this. I'm not massively fussed.

Actually I was waiting for https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/1649#issuecomment-177268279

Yeh, well, not sure people would actually want that because it means they can't control the filename if we're arbitrarily appending stuff to it.
