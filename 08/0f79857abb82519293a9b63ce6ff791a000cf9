@julienfalque

this PR makes one fixer fix more cases, you call it bugfix (targeting 2.6)

#3089 makes one fixer fix mor cases, you call it feature (targeting master)

@keradus I consider this one a bugfix because IMO it's something that should have been part of the initial implementation and is missing, while for #3089 it's not the case. Though I'm fine with considering this one as a new feature as well, your call :)

Picked [`2.6`](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/tree/2.6) as target branch now.

@localheinz That was actually not needed as @keradus changed the target milestone to `2.7` (current master), which means we consider this a new feature. Sorry for the trouble.
