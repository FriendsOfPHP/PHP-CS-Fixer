@GrahamCampbell if this fix #485 could you add testcase?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-09-03T15:37:33Z

Can that go through in a separate pull?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-09-03T15:46:44Z

For what reason?
You said it fixes #485, so please add a testcase here.
See no need for separate PR - testcase added to master will not pass without that change.

This will also be required for my contrib fixer for semicolons.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-09-03T15:48:00Z

That is, when I get around to writing it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great - so you made a fix here, will add a testcase here, we will merge it into master and - you will have it for your contrib fixer. And if you will want to make fixer earlier - then just cherry-pick changes you need from other branch. I do it so often between FunctionDeclarationSpacesFixer, UnusedUseFixer and StructureBracesFixer.

Or am I missing sth?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-09-03T15:53:07Z

I'll add a test case (or a few) here before I start on the other stuff later tonight.

How does this look now @keradus?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-09-14T08:55:35Z

@keradus Supporting all those whitespace characters seems to have broken things.

What is the point of cloning Travis link? All of us see it near commit hash.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-09-14T08:59:14Z

I was just linking you to hhvm because if you look at the php ones they've crashed quite early on, so aren't very useful, so I was trying to save you some time there.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-09-14T09:00:49Z

No need to clone info that is already available ;)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-09-14T09:04:00Z

Fix basing only on php output: #558
Please rebase your PR.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-09-14T09:08:53Z

Will do...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-09-14T09:11:25Z

Seems to be working now. :)
