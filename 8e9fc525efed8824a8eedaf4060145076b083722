PSR5 proposal suggest to change `@var` into `@type` (https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/pull/169/files).
Just mention ;)

Yeh, I'm aware of the PSR proposal, thanks.

It is a "proposal" though, it's not accepted.

by keradus at 2014-08-31T12:46:20Z

Yes. I even said that in my comment ;)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-08-31T12:46:37Z

Sure.

:+1:
And I'm in favor of keeping ``@var`` for now. It has better IDE support

@stof Yeh, that was my reason. :)

> There was a mixture of these, so I went for @var since it's supported by more ides/text editors.

Is this good to merge then?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@GrahamCampbell the ``+1`` mean that exactly. Just give @keradus the time to merge the different PRs. He cannot do it for all PRs at the same time.

Sorry, yeh.
