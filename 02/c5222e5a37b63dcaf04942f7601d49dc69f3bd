@fabpot please take a look at fabbot's status. It fails and tries to fix type notation inside strings like `integer` into `int`.
Our PHP CS Fixer already done that by `PhpdocScalarFixer` that does not modify strings.
Please, could you consider removing that part of fabbot in favor of that fixer? One bug less and it should be little faster (not doing same thing twice)

Done... and your PR is now green :)
