regardless of real change proposed in this PR, looking at your steps, you understand our cycle pretty well :+1:

I think there is no need to review `PostIncrementFixer`. Please make `IncrementStyleFixer` directly and then we could review, as it's the combined fixer that will deserve a review.

Your understanding of the PHP CS Fixer is pretty nice @kubawerlos !
To be honest not much here that I could add as review concerns.

Please deprecate original fixer ;)
