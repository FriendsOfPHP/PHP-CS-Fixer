Is this to work with class methods as well? Tests and description should be updated to reflect that if so.

I've updated some tests, I don't think the doc is off as methods are function (not always true the otherway around)

Oh one last thing from me, could you add a test for `interface` as well?

Suggestions for adding this fixer to a set? (maybe a PHP migration one, SF, projects one?)

maybe the sets `[@Symfony, @PhpCsFixer]` are OK? :)
