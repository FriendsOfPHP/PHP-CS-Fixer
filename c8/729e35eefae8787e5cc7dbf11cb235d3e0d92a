problem here is that the integration test will resolve the fixers _and_ configure those before checking the requirements set in the test.

Why it is a problem ?

I check if the configuration of the fixer makes sense based on the env., so this will fail:
https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/2274/files#diff-00016b9c4b10354d36ed225366173552R58

even if I set the requirements of the test on 5.4

then why not simply check requirements before creating fixers? (what actually makes perfect sense)

This PR also fixes using `setFormat()` in a configuration file as it was not used by the Fixer (i.e. it would always run with the value given on commandline or fall back on 'txt').

could we separated that fix? PR getting bigger and bigger already, and that bugfix is not directly related

Expect Travis PHP5.3 to fail because of https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/2285
