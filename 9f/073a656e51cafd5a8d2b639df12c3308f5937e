LGTM, sadly the test fails on a not related issue (`echo: write error: Broken pipe`)

Thank you, @SpacePossum! Noticed this locally as well, but focused only on `PhpUnitTestAnnotation` fixer here.

@SpacePossum

Initially I had three methods

- `hasTestPrefix()`
- `canRemoveTestPrefix()`
- `removeTestPrefix()`

What do you think, would the code be easier to understand if there was a single method to handle all of that? Similarly, for adding a test prefix, if necessary? After all, thereâ€™s some temporal coupling involved, as we always invoke `hasTestPrefix()`, immediately followed by `removeTestPrefix()`.

then `removeTestPrefix` would need to check `hasTestPrefix` internally to decouple the methods.
if there is a need to call one method but not another (even conditionally), then 2 methods are fine.
if we always call them in chain (even conditionally), I don't see value of splitting them

@keradus @SpacePossum

On second thought, we use `hasTestPrefix()` in two different scenarios:

* when verifying that we need to remove
* when verifying that we need to add

So I guess it's ok to leave them separate.

How about a bit of renaming, though? Please hang on for the next commit.

the current PR'ed composition of methods and their naming looks spot on to me :+1:

@BackEndTea @keradus @SpacePossum

I added one more test case, but other than that, I can't think of anything else to add at the moment.

Thanks for improving my code a bit @localheinz

Somehow I missed that.
@localheinz , please rebase so I could merge it
