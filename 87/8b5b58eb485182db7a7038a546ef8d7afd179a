Ready for a review @keradus //cc @SpacePossum

UPD: it's pretty much checked by UTs (interfaces, all descriptions and etc.) - really helpful

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

out of the curiosity: self-checking the Fixer class by utests were nice for you or not really ?
(things like interfaces, definition and so on)

Looking good :)
Please add the following test cases (these pass btw, so :+1:)
```php
// config: not yoda style, nested calls
        $this->doTest(
            '<?php $b = a(a(a(b() === null) === null) === null) === null;',
            '<?php $b = \is_null(a(\is_null(a(\is_null(a(\is_null(b())))))));'
        );
```

```php
// config: yoda style, nested calls
            array(
                '<?php null === a(null === a(null === a(null === b())));',
                '<?php \is_null(a(\is_null(a(\is_null(a(\is_null(b())))))));',
            ),
```

Added the suggested test cases as well.

Something wrong with travis builds:

```log

README.rst file is not up to date! Do not modify it manually! Regenerate readme with command: `php php-cs-fixer readme > README.rst`.

I think you need to regen. the README (maybe rebase first), the generator has been modified not long ago
(edit it was done here https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/2419)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2016-12-23T12:45:07Z

Like the utest message ask you for :D

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by kalessil at 2016-12-27T12:36:16Z

Rebased, force-pushed. Will reopen the PR as it green again.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by SpacePossum at 2016-12-27T12:56:01Z

it won't get green here if you don't reopen ;)
did you do the regen?
```bash
$ php php-cs-fixer readme > README.rst`
```

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by kalessil at 2016-12-27T12:57:57Z

Did exactly the same.

If you login into travis with github account, it runs automated build for commits automatically. So I actually nedd just to wait for several minutes and will re-open the PR.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by SpacePossum at 2016-12-27T13:00:59Z

ah awesome : )

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by kalessil at 2016-12-30T08:34:49Z

Are we fine with the PR? Perhaps someone can even merge it?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by SpacePossum at 2016-12-30T09:41:45Z

please fix the little typo
https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/2415#discussion_r94065279

and maybe update the config hint to:
```php
    /**
      * @var array<string, bool>
      */
     private $configuration;
```

However IMO these are not blocking for merging. I'm :+1:
