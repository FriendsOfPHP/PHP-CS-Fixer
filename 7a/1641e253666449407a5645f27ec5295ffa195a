in https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/5305 , yaml lint took 5s
do we need this PR, actually ?

5s to compute something when we already know it in advance is still a waste. Since it's really easy to avoid it, why not do it?

with the check you added, it increased by 2s , actually

I think these extra 2s are caused by usual CI performance variations rather than a fast check on whether a YAML was changed :)
