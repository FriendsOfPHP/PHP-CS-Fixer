We need to add this to our internal conflicts list since this conflicts with PSR2.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

`(! $foo)` is permitted within PSR-2, but `( ! $foo)` is not.

Thank you for the feedback @GrahamCampbell. Is that change something actionable on my side?

No, something to us to note when the conflict checks are written. :)

How about having a fixer to just make sure that there's a space to the right of a `!`?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by phansys at 2015-07-16T16:02:35Z

You mean an extra fixer for that? I could add a new one if that's your suggestion.

@GrahamCampbell is that a standard anywhere? If it would be usefull somewhere then yeah, why not. But if it won't then there is no need.

Laravel would use it if we could, but no such fixer exists.

@GrahamCampbell, if there is some reference for this or if someone else agrees, I'll work on it.

I'm on the core team. :)

@GrahamCampbell, it's ok then. Here you are: #1306.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2015-07-23T20:13:58Z

What about https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/1306#issuecomment-122811837 ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by phansys at 2015-07-23T20:17:39Z

I was waiting for the confirmation there (at #1306) @keradus. If you can confirm that solves the issue, I'll apply the same here.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2015-07-23T20:20:25Z

OK, done: https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/1306#issuecomment-124228577 ;)
Sorry, I was extra busy last week...

No problem at all @keradus, thank you.
