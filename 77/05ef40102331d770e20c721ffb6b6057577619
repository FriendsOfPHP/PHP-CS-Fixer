Hi and thanks for your PR!

I think this is happening on 2.15 as well, maybe you can target that branch? You removed both the self-update statements, do we not need one?

Sure thing!

We don't need not a one. [Travis CI does that for us by default.](https://travis-ci.com/github/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/jobs/439868381#L196)

No prob. It wasn't a mistake when this was added initially, just for the record. At that time Travis CI wouldn't update to Composer v2 because it wasn't released yet.
