`NoEmptyPhpdocFixer` ?

closing till I figured out how to fix it (https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/1765#discussion_r52298636)

@SpacePossum , please play with utests so the utests will define everything that should be fixed and how - when it will be done (or it is already?) I will help with regexp

Renamed, replaced the `fail` with `throw exception` (thanks @GrahamCampbell ) and added a bunch of integration tests (include case for removal of `@access` thanks @keradus).
Given that some of the tests are still running, I think the one thing (and most important thing) is to figure out the rule on which to remove a PHPDoc.
I like it as is, but I see the point @keradus is making.
It will be tricky to tweak though, so lets list some cases here.
I think we agree on these:
```php
/** */

/**
*/

/**
 *
 *
 */
```
However, the fixer also removes:
```php
/**
**/

/*******
 *
 *****/

/**
 * *
 */
```
I'm happy with both sets, so let me know were to aim for :)

For 6 cases you provided I woudn't touch only the last one, in which `*` is summary part of PHPDoc. Odd, not nice, but still valid.

I like it as-is.

@SpacePossum All cases you provided are also in utests, am I right ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by SpacePossum at 2016-02-13T17:10:50Z

@keradus yes I think so, I checked and cannot think of anymore other cases, let me know I you have any in mind.

Cool!
Please, move it to Symfony level
