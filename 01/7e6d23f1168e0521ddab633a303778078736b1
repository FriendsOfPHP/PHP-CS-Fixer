will this resolve the priority issue (https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/issues/1715#issuecomment-248524932) as well or is that out of scope for this PR?

it was raised after my PR was made ;)
it may not even be an issue - i guess we have proper priority for those 2 fixers, but yeah, integration test would be nice
