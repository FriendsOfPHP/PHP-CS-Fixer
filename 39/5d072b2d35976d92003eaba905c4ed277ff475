Mmm, I've redacted the fixer that way because all the fixers of the same kind as redacted so, I guess to provide forward compatibility. Not that I have a preference on the topic, just to share why it is so.

@Slamdunk not all of them have it, this option is to let the fixer fix differently for different target and this one has all the assertions it's introducing added in one PHPUnit version.
