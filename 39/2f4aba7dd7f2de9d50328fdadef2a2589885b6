As this is not a bug fix, doesn't it belong on `master`?

It's not a new feature nor a deprecation so I see no reason not to merge this in the lowest branch. Unless we want to have epic merge conflicts if a bugfix is merged afterwards :)

Ping @SpacePossum I've been running these changes for around 2 weeks now, and not noticed any issues. :)
