I will need to take a deeper look into it as diff is crappy here

Yeah. Maybe it is easier to look first at my implementation without diff: https://github.com/gharlan/PHP-CS-Fixer/blob/madv-closures/Symfony/CS/Fixer/Symfony/MethodArgumentDefaultValueFixer.php

And then search the lines in diff where you want to comment something.

That's the plan ;)
