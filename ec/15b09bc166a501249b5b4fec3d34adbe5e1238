> fabbot.io — The rules contain unknown fixers (non_printable_character).

Does this mean fabbot.io is executing our .php_cs file? If so, that's definitely a bad idea, since someone can send a PR and execute arbitrary code on their servers.

it's ok as fabbot runs it in virtualized sandbox
in the end, it's not up to me or you, but up to fabbot.

What sort of information could be leaked from the sandbox is the real question I guess.

It's up to the infrastructure and fabbot.io decided they are prepared enough to do this.
If you want, raise a concern directly to them, not here.
