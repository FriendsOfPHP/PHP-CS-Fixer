Lots of failing tests now.

@keradus is there anything else I can do ?

someone please kick the Travis tests again, it failed because it got stalled

@DarkaOnLine https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/2280#discussion_r87712447 is still not resolved

@GrahamCampbell can you take a look (i think this a laravel standard)?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@SpacePossum I think he already reviewed it here: https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/2148#issuecomment-258633327

And then PR has been modified and adjusted for master branch, and then has few things raised to be updated (already done), so would be great to have final review, even if it would be quick one ;)

@GrahamCampbell,  please review this :pray:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This looks reasonable in principle. I'll need a bit of time to test this in more detail.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by DarkaOnLine at 2016-12-14T08:16:45Z

@keradus can we move forward ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2016-12-21T10:23:46Z

Needs rebasing again. Might be an idea to actually "rebase", rather than having merge commits. Will make it much easier going forward.
