I'm pretty sure the correct form for `inheritdoc` is all lower case, with no upper case `D`. That's how php documentor already reference it, and that's how their proposed psr standard uses it: https://github.com/phpDocumentor/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/phpdoc.md.

I see ambiguity here.

I just looked at the source code for phpdocumentor, and they use all lower case in there. Their website must just have typos on it where someone thought it was with an uppercase D.
