Please, add integration test for that

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-09-27T14:02:24Z

Does the 1.10 branch have integration tests?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2015-09-27T14:10:14Z

No, but it doesn't mean we may ommit tests during fixing a bug.
Take a look at #1419 and #1420 (originally second contains first inside)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-09-27T15:11:59Z

Can we merge this then?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-09-27T15:12:19Z

And I'll send a second PR to 1.11 once you've merged 1.10->1.11, with an integration test.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2015-09-27T15:17:37Z

Please send a PR to 1.11 with a fix and tests, and when tests prove the fix works - we will merge this PR into 1.10, and then the second PR to 1.11

I'll sort this at the weekend with the psr4 fixer.

Is appveyor working?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2015-10-02T19:23:48Z

change PR commits (eg ammend empty changes to last commit and force push it) to recreate the build for AppVeyor

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-10-02T20:13:47Z

I just did force push.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-10-02T20:13:52Z

And that broke it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2015-10-02T20:25:32Z

I did forced push on other PR and it restart AppVeyor

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-10-02T20:59:14Z

Well, it was because of a force push that I noticed this broken. I'll deal with this at the weekend though, like I originally said. ;)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2015-10-04T19:28:53Z

ping @GrahamCampbell ;P

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-10-04T19:33:45Z

Just reset, re-commited, and force pushed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-10-04T19:33:51Z

Still not working...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2015-10-04T19:36:49Z

Then simply ignore AppVeyor and work on tests.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-10-04T19:39:18Z

Already doing that. PR incoming. :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-10-12T14:33:14Z

How does this look now?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2015-10-12T15:16:46Z

Passing. :)
