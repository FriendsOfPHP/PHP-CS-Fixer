cc @sstok, you have always asked for bumping it, I think it's good moment for doing this (bumping min PHP version)

Wouldn't `^2.8|^3.0` be better? As Symfony 3.0 is just Symfony 2.8 with deprecated code removed, if your code is compatible with 3.0, then it is automatically compatible with 2.8.

Anyway, 👍 for idea. Should the code related to old versions of Symfony be dropped in this PR as well?

The removal of deprecated code in 3.0 is a good reason to jump to it :)
It makes sure our code doesn't use deprecated SF code, but also that users of the code in this repo are.

where needed yes, everything else can be done all in time

(note to self; https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/17255 can now be used in the tests)

The test suite runs on 3.x so deprecated code from 2.x can't be used anyway. Removing the `^2.8` part of the constraint would force every side project to update to 3.x even if their code is compatible with 2.8. And I don't think keeping 2.8 would be a maintenance burden.
