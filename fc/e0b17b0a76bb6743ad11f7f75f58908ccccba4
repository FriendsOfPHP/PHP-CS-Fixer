What do you think @marcaube ?
I can't figure it out why it is needed to check prev token.

@keradus It was needed for parameters on multiple lines like

```php
$var = func(
    $foo,
    $bar,
    [1, 2, 3]
);
```

It may no longer be needed after your refactoring.

@marcaube Is there a test case for that?

There was [one](https://github.com/fabpot/PHP-CS-Fixer/blob/master/Symfony/CS/Tests/Fixer/PSR2/ParenthesisFixerTest.php#L29) but it was not updated with the code.

The fixer now only check control structures, the test should be updated to reflect that.
