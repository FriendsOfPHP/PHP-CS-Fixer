~40 files, ~800 lines, hard for careful review here... are you confident about this PR?

please rebase anyway

Yeah I'm sure about this one,
for the review please just focus on the changes of the Fixers.
The other tests are nice, however if those pass than those pass and are of value to add to the repo.
Will rebase soon!

Alternative I'm happy to open PR's for each fixer + its test and have one PR for all tests passing without changes to their fixers.

Nah, I agree that it wouldn't bring much value, just current PR is not sth that could be properly reviewed in 5 minutes ;)

rebase :)
Yeah this won't a 5 minutes one, sorry about that.
However it is important as the Fixers touched do break valid code so need updating.
