Because I'm lazy, I tried replacing

As a heads-up, with some experimenting, I used PhpStorm regular expressions to find and replace, replacing

```
(^\s+|return\s|,\s|=\s|=>\s|\?\s|:\s|!|\()(?!(array|empty|exit|do|for|foreach|if|while|isset|list|unset|__))(\w+)\(
```

with

```
$1\\$3\(
```

In general, I am for the change, but not in this form. It's hard to maintain and keep it consistent.

Instead, I propose:
1. PR with a rule to add that `\` without dummy regexes that will fail on edge cases
2. then apply it on repo
3. and keep rule running under CI

@keradus

Sounds good, let me take a look at it!

Actually missing quite a bunch of functions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

did someone compare if with the import of these function (`use function \array_keys;` etc.) also gives the same benefits?

@keradus @SpacePossum

How about this one?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2017-01-15T16:38:16Z

@SpacePossum it shall, as engine will, as well as with `echo \implode($x)`, do function lookup, but it will take it from import

I let myself fix https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/2462/files#r96804912

@localheinz can you fix the 5.6 issue, it is a test thing only I think :)
and please rebase as well.

Love to see this in!
(as I would like to build upon it to add config option to import rather than to add '\' for all native calls)

> as I would like to build upon it to add config option to import rather than to add '' for all native calls

let us make it first as adding `\` (as it's simpler and easier), then with time we could add option to decide to import them instead of prefixing.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by localheinz at 2017-01-28T00:45:18Z

Ha, sorry for the delay, will take a look tomorrow!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by localheinz at 2017-01-28T00:54:53Z

Tests should pass, take a look!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2017-01-30T11:11:48Z

@SpacePossum , I am not sure about that `include`... it's not good practice to create global functions... I'm not for encouraging people to use them by adding setting just for that

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by SpacePossum at 2017-01-30T12:17:44Z

@keradus fair enough :) @localheinz please ignore my comment :+1:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2017-01-31T13:04:19Z

@localheinz, is there anything left in this PR, or ready for merge ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by localheinz at 2017-01-31T13:05:00Z

@keradus

I can't think of anything, if you are all happy with it, let's ðŸš€ it!
