```php
<?php

switch(new \stdClass()) {
    case (new \stdClass()) : {
        echo 123;
    }
}
```

I think `case` and `default` are missing as well.

Kindly note: I've no idea how we should tokenize mess like this;

```php
<?php

switch(new \stdClass()) {
    case (((new \stdClass()))) : {
        echo 123;
    }
}
```

This passes linting as well
```php
include_once (new \stdClass());
```

In the first example I think we should not exclude the braces: `case` does not require braces at all so it makes sense to treat those as _"instantiation braces"_ IMO.

I'm not sure about `include_once` either: https://3v4l.org/p2Kiq.

fair enough, lets add all the (odd) cases in a utest anyway, just to check what happens with the fixers that cause the ticket (3202)
