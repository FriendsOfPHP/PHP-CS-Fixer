Thanks so much for picking this up!
I don't know much about the changes you made, I simply don't have the experience :)
I'll try to learn a bit about it, but looks good!

@SpacePossum please temporary merge this PR into your once that has problems with AppVeyor and let see if it will help

thanks, done over @ https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/1949 (please note I made changes because that PR targets master, but as a POC it should be useful for now)

So, this fixes AppVeyor bug of #1949 @SpacePossum
(related Travis fail is due to quick cherry-pick without solving conflicts on .travis.yml)

Indeed, AppVeyor is happy, so :ship: this :)
(Maybe in some other life I try to figure out want went wrong with the previous setup)

AppVeyor break it's PHPUnit, I remember that it happens once with Travis as well.
