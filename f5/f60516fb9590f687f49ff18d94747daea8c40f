Oops, missed one. Thanks for catching that.

please add a testcase:
```php
            array(
                '<?php $a = new $longName[\'class\']() ;',
                '<?php $a = new $longName[\'class\'] ;',
            ),
```

It will fail :(

Please rebase your branch to remove all these ugly merge commits.

See http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/patches.html#rebase-your-patch for the way to rebase

For some reason you have two authors @wjaspers : `Will Jaspers` and `wjaspers`.
Could you squash commits manually to left only one of them?

GitHub uses the commit author e-mail for linking to the user profile.
One is gmail.com the other bestbuy.com

You should be able to fix this by adding the secondary email address in your profile.
https://github.com/settings/emails

@sstok that was actually the problem, i dont want the secondary email to be exposed at all and i tried to fix it (the wrong way).
