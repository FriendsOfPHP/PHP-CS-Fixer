BTW, what do you think @GrahamCampbell about using external docblock parser like `phpDocumentor\Reflection\DocBlock` or `Sami\ParserDocBlockParser` (build on first one) ?
Then we won't need to maintain all crazy variants of phpdocs ourselves

Because external parsers don't offer the things we want, and implement a load of things we don't need. That's why I didn't use them originally.

@keradus the issue is that PHP-CS-Fixer actually needs info about formatting, to be able to fix it.

OK, just the thought to reduce possible bugs. Thank you both for quick answer ;)
