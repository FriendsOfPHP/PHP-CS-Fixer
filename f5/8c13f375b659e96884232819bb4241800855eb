I would like to remove the `risky` flag, since the fixer wouldn't produce anymore erroneous code.

What do you think?

@keradus ping, at least for labels & milestones 🙏

@Slamdunk , sorry for big delay, simply too many things recently and i hoped someone else will pick the thread up (I was active in threads I participated previously, but was trying to not dive in too much threads at same time :( )

riskiness:
let us see after final version of changes ;)

---------------

label/milestone:
it's debatable and I could advocate both approaches, but so far we treated "better support of newer language syntax" as bugfixes and sent those to lowest supported branch (currently: 2.2)
(in the end, currently 2.2 removes the `retrurn **null**` where it shouldn't)

WDYT?

My request for label/milestone was just to set some reminders. I respect your great efforts and time spent in this project, I don't expect a rapid merge, just that without labels it's easy to lose the plot.

Rebased onto 2.2, I agree.

for me, now the fixer doesn't look risky indeed.

Riskyness removed

Since the removal of riskyness, it wasn't clear enough what now this Fixer does. I've added a `VersionSpecificCodeSample` to be clear.
