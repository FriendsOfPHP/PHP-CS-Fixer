I like the idea :)

About failing tests, please decrease the guard, it would be a valid change as you up'ped the number of descriptions :+1:

The other one is related to a limitation we have on the testing process itself. Currently when testing if a code sample is valid it is not possible to define the PHP requirement(s) of the sample. I would like suggest to run these test on PHP 7 only for now, as it would suit more (/most) cases, but that needs some discussion first.

btw. just out of curiosity; how you like 2.0 so far?
