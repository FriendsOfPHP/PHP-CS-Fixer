can we merge https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/pull/3367 first, to prevent merge hell ;)

Rebased onto 2.2, squashing @kubawerlos' commits and fixing conflicts.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

please rebase, now, 2.2 contains other fix to this fixer done by SpacePossum.
you need to keep it in tests, about src - up to you how to handle that

sorry for the merge issues @julienfalque , lemme know if you've questions about my changes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rebased.

No worries @SpacePossum, conflicts were not hard to solve, thanks :)

If you don't mind, I did a rebase to 2.10.4 here https://github.com/IchHabRecht/PHP-CS-Fixer/tree/no-unused-imports-rewrite

@IchHabRecht This PR targets 2.2 as it is the lowest maintained branch where the fixer can be improved.

Thanks for working on it again. Needed the patch file for a project of mine anyway ;-)

@julienfalque , could you open a sibling PR (without closing this one!) but targetting `master`, as I got too many conflicts after merge of #3276 ?
thanks !

@keradus Why do you need to duplicate the PR againt master?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2018-03-21T13:25:33Z

because I have no clue how to resolve conflicts during merging this PR into master (with 2.2 in the middle, of course).

for that, if you would show how this fixer shall look like on master, i would pick it up for conflicts resolving during 2.2->master merging
