Great that you take care of that fixer !

IMO it is good to remove that leading whitespaces.
You may change previous token when you met T_WHITESPACE in loop

Can't find the rule for whitespaces before T_NAMESPACE.
Maybe indeed this behavior should be removed from this fixer (Then it would be nice to create fixer for it in SYMFONY_LEVEL)

I've added a new fixer.
I saw somewhere in the comments that some projects use the `<?php namespace My\Namespace;` (i.e. without a newline between `<?php` and `namespace`), so I've made sure this works as well.

Are those changes to the readme auto-generated through the command, because they need to be?

If there were not then the Travis job will failed.

They are auto-generated as requested in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

Some of these test cases my be easier to read/maintain if they were actually split out on to multiple lines rather than trying to keep them on one line.

Oh, @keradus already mentioned that. I agree with him then. :)
