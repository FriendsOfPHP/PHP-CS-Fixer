Please, try rebase on 1.5 now

Sidenote: rename OneBlankLinesBeforeNamespaceFixer to
SingleBlankLineBeforeNamespaceFixer

one blanks is also incorrect english

I went for single because of `single_array_no_trailing_comma` already existing. Nice and consistent.

Or perhaps we should rethink, we have single_line_after_  etc and we have
one_blank_etc/no_blank_etc

I think using the word blank everywhere would make most sense

Oops. the title should say `SingleBlankLineBeforeNamespaceFixer`. That's what I intended.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ceeram at 2014-12-17T00:17:33Z

im fine with single, but was also refering to line/blank and even forgot
blankline, which you just mentioned.

I would suggest the following namig when blanklines are involved in fixer
name:

single_blank_line_etc
no_blank_line_etc

how does that sound?

by ceeram at 2014-12-17T00:25:34Z

Also noticed a fixer name: NoEmptyLinesAfterPhpdocs

I guess ill open an issue for 2.0 milestone to review all fixer names to make them more consistent

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-12-17T00:26:39Z

Refs: #881

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-12-17T00:27:06Z

Yeh. I'll close #881, and we can all discuss names on a dedicated issue.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ceeram at 2014-12-17T00:29:20Z

Why close? this is targeted at 1.5, but the existing fixers cannot be renamed in 1.x, that will have to wait for 2.0 anyway.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-12-17T00:32:59Z

 I haven't closed this, just my pull to 2.0 for reasons discussed on there.

Your latest commit? that only contain removal of calculateIndent() ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-12-17T23:05:01Z

And the addition of comments. I can't rename the function - it's already in 1.4.

Alright, this is done, and ready for review. // cc @keradus @ceeram

@ceeram Your input last time was really helpful - thank you!

NB, the utils changes were moved since they are now totally independent of this pull.

btw, please rebase

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rebased.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-12-22T11:20:31Z

Except that one minor...
:+1:

name for consistency could be as proposed, we need to rethink all names (see #889)

have you done any regression of this PR ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-12-22T11:27:12Z

> have you done any regression of this PR ?

Yeh, I tested it on all my repos, and on symfony at the same time I regression tested that other psr2 pull request. I found no problems. :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2014-12-22T14:41:08Z

@keradus Rebased, and fixed that issue. Mergy mergy?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2014-12-22T14:51:20Z

Yeah, I was waiting for that one minor to be fixed ;)
