Please rebase on master, we can't marge it.

@keradus ill wait with that untill you decide to actually merge

Fix is good - now it fixes tabs too.
:+1:

Btw, it doesn't fix case from 833:
```php
    /**
 * Used to write a value to a session key.
 *
 * ...
 */
public function write($name) {}
```

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@keradus It does fix 833, he was using tabs, which was the cause.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ceeram at 2014-12-14T19:40:02Z

Also rebased

Great! Then please add
```php
    /**
 * Used to write a value to a session key.
 *
 * ...
 */
public function write($name) {}
```

to tests and prove this will be changed into
```php
/**
 * Used to write a value to a session key.
 *
 * ...
 */
public function write($name) {}
```

all cases should be covered by tests to not be broken in the future.

His issue was the other way around, it was adding too much indentation on first line.
I will add a testcase anyway for your suggestion

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ceeram at 2014-12-14T19:49:50Z

Testcase added

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ceeram at 2014-12-14T19:51:09Z

Perhaps i should duplicate all testcase that test against 4 spaces for tabs as well, that would be the only way to really test all cases

Can't see point of it. Didn't you added crucial ones?

:+1:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by ceeram at 2014-12-14T19:58:56Z

You are right, i thought this one was also already covered with spaces, but seems it doesnt. Its fine now
