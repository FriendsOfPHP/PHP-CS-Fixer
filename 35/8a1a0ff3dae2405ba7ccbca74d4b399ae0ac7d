What do we do if files contain other whitespace like spaces before the end. Do we need tests for those cases too?

Maybe; do you have example code in mind that needs to be added to the test? I'm happy to ad it.

(PS. the code on master has been diverted in a way that this PR might not be merged upstream, I can work on a similar for master as well if this one is OK'ed)

Updated, I hope I got all the feedback right :)

(will rebase & squash and come up with a fix for master if needed as this is PR is OK'ed so I won't loose the feedback from people till then)

@GrahamCampbell could you review this (https://github.com/SpacePossum/PHP-CS-Fixer/commit/78f7c1cc41befa098ce9e4b683ba862dbd30f742) to see if this fixes the issue with Windows/Mac EOL you reported?

BTW, is this PR now fixes #1092 as well ?

Yes, I hope so :)
