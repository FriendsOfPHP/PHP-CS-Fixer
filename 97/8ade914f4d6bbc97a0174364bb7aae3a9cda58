Why is there a commit in this PR claiming to fix #971 while the ticket has been closed by @keradus saying it is not a bug ?

@stof This PR is based off of other PRs. Some comments do not belong to th Ereg fixer and have possibly been fixed (but not merged/rebased yet) in the parent PRs.

I find we should come back to this PR after it's dependencies will be closed (#972, #973).
