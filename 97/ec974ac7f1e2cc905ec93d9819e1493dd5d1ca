Ref #1295

This is kind of more of a feature than a bug fix I think @keradus. Wondering if maybe 1.10 is a better target?

Also, we were looking for a place for me to update my email address across the code base, could I do that here @keradus?

I agree it may be treaten like enhance or bugfix.
But it was intended to fix long form to short form of types in phpdocs, we just missed that one annotation. Personally it's a bugfix to me.

Sure. That's what I first thought too when I selected the 1.9 branch. :)
