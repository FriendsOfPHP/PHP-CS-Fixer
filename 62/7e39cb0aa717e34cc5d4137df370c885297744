Nice work and :+1:  for concept.
About priorities there is some stuff to check out I think, like when rules remove lines (`phpdoc_no_useless_inheritdoc` and others) or add lines (`phpdoc_add_missing_param_annotation` and possibly others), together with locking down the priority with `phpdoc_to_comment`

@BackEndTea Do you think that could be finalised for 2.14?

I won't have time until somewhere next week to work on this.

@BackEndTea , feel free to ping us when you consider this ready.
in the meantime, i'm changing the milestone for this PR

@keradus Sorry for the long delay on this, I kinda forgot about it.

Currently this only works for class methods, properties and constants, and i'm not 100% sure how to expand it to also work with functions, classes and other doc blocks.

I think that is a great set to start with (if that is somewhere in the description of the fixer :+1: ) as it would cover most common cases.

I agree with SpacePossum, it would be great to see this released as it stands.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@SpacePossum & @keradus  Sorry for the long wait on this, but I have updated it, and it is ready for review.

I have rebased this and fixed a few remarks people had.
Current concerns are:
* The fact that its 'incomplete' e.g. only class properties, constants and methods. But this should work as is.
* Priorities with other fixes
* The fact that this includes updates to the `DocBlock` class. This isn't a final class and could be extended by others.

@BackEndTea ,
the CI is failing, this is a blocker to proceed with the PR :(
can you fix it, please ?

@BackEndTea do you have time to work on this?

I think we should find a better name for this one, because it can be used for both directions.

I think replacing `to` with `or` makes clear that it's purpose is to make sure it's always either single or multi, so `SingleOrMultiLinePhpdocFixer`. In fact, I see now that the branch is already called that ðŸ˜†

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by localheinz at 2019-07-19T13:21:23Z

Perhaps `PhpdocLineSpanFixer`?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by SpacePossum at 2019-10-10T08:26:36Z

rebased, conflicts resolved, fixed unit tests, fixed code style to new standard, rename the fixer, forced pushed, in preparation of merging
