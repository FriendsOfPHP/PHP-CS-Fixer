I actually asked you to change base branch of already existing PR instead of creating new PR, but it's fine as well ;)
closing other PR, as only this one may be merged

LGTM ;)

No problem ;) I created a new one also because changing the base branch from the web interface was bringing the whole 2.5 branch with it onto 2.2!

it's because you change the branch to lower one.
if you take a look, change a branch is... doing a rebase. `git rebase` of branch is also needed when you rebase the PR targed
