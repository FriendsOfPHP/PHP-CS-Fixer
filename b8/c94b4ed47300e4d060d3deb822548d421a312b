Nice. :)

Maybe we could automatically infer the command name from the class name too?

And the level based on the namespace?

We could keep the interface the same, and have an AbstractFixer class to do the logic here?

I could send a pull for that after this goes through if you like?

I'll add it my list of things to do.

@Graham I thought about that. See that all my recent (let say 1-2 weeks) changes that not modify Fixer content are going in that direction. Just want to send changes as atomic as they could be.
I do already have that change locally.

Ok, cool. :) It seemed the natural progression.
