Fix type "loading" -> "loaded"

the warning would still be valid if the command is used outside of the phar I think?

I assumed the Xdebug handler works for any PHP CLI process, not only phar files. @AJenbo is that right? If so the warning would never be shown, unless one explicitly disables the handler at runtime somehow, but then showing a warning would not make sense as the user *does* want to use Xdebug.

Correct, setting the constant PHP_CS_FIXER_ALLOW_XDEBUG will allow running with xdebug, I'll update the PR with the warning stripped

> unless one explicitly disables the handler at runtime somehow

if I use the command in my app I by-pass the handler, but not explicit (I use my own bootstrap and not the `/php-cs-fixer` file)

I'd say that in this case your app should be responsible of showing the warning, not each single command.

fair enough :)

ping @AJenbo could you add some tests (using the tool as a PHAR and as a regular PHP file) please?

@julienfalque not sure how to set that up but I will give it a stab.
