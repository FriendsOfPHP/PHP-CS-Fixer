Also, Travis is red

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by SpacePossum at 2016-02-14T10:38:55Z

that is because of the TODO, the integration tests are not done, just stubbed :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2016-02-14T10:40:41Z

OK, cool ;)

Is there a test case similar to this?

```php
if ($x) {
    if ($y) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return 2;
    }
} else {
    return 3;
}
```

Should stay @ contrib level. I think this one is ready, please play around with it :)

Could anyone handle the review?

@SpacePossum could you squash commits of yours into one and then leave @gharlan at the end?

>@SpacePossum could you squash commits of yours into one and then leave @gharlan at the end?

Sure thing :)
I'll work on this a bit more, little refactor, and than squash after the review.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2016-03-13T12:12:52Z

Oh, I thought it's ready to merge.
When done please remove WIP label

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Happy to take review comments and thoughts on this one to wrap up it up :)
ping @gharlan and @keradus and everyone else.

Missing tests for else with colons?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by SpacePossum at 2016-04-21T12:18:46Z

wish they killed the alternative syntax in PHP7... oh well.. lets see...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2016-04-21T12:21:01Z

#PHP8 :P

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

>Missing tests for else with colons?

Test and a minor speed gain added. I didn't put effort in detecting / cleanup useless else statements done in the alternative syntax because it is no fun and an edge case anyway.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by SpacePossum at 2016-05-23T15:12:47Z

Updated, rebased and clean upped.
The commit history looks a bit odd now with @gharlan being the author of the whole test file, hope he doesn't mind.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2016-05-23T18:32:46Z

Please, could you recommit to retrigger Travis? Also, put no_useless_else to .php_cs file

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by GrahamCampbell at 2016-05-23T19:23:03Z

@keradus Or just close and re-open the PR.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by keradus at 2016-05-23T19:35:48Z

Didn't know that trick, thanks ;)
(But it's sad we need to have tricks for Travis :/)

@keradus you should be able to restart builds because you have write permissions to the repo.

@gharlan usually it is like that and I do it often, sadly this time it wasn't about crashed build, but the build was not triggered at all, so I have no build to restart  - I needed to retrigger it ;)
